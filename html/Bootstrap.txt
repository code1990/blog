Firstly, it lays the foundation for a particular view of the bootstrap. Secondly, it gives an account of Edgeworth expansion. The first two chapters deal with the bootstrap and Edgeworth expansion respectively, while chapters 3 and 4 bring these two themes together, using Edgeworth expansion to explore and develop the properties of the bootstrap. The book is aimed at graduate level for those with some exposure to the methods of theoretical statistics. However, technical details are delayed until the last chapter such that mathematically able readers without knowledge of the rigorous theory of probability will have no trouble understanding most of

popular data-resampling methods used in statistical analysis. This book provides a systematic introduction to the theory of the jackknife, bootstrap and other resampling methods that have been developed in the last twenty years. It aims to provide a guide to using these methods which will enable applied statisticians to feel comfortable in applying them to data in their own research. The authors have included examples of applying these methods in various applications in both the independent and identically distributed (iid) case and in more complicated cases with non-iid data sets. Readers are assumed to have a reasonable knowledge of mathematical statistics and so this will be made suitable reading for graduate students, researchers and practitioners seeking a wide-ranging survey of this important area of statistical theory and application.","series":{"id":"24296","title":"Springer Series in Statistics"},"price":"USD 119.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Syed Fazle Rahman"],"pubdate":"2014-7-4","tags":[{"count":4,"name":"Bootstrap","title":"Bootstrap"},{"count":3,"name":"Web","title":"Web"},{"count":2,"name":"设计","title":"设计"},{"count":2,"name":"WEB","title":"WEB"},{"count":2,"name":"CSS","title":"CSS"},{"count":1,"name":"编程","title":"编程"},{"count":1,"name":"Web-Framework","title":"Web-Framework"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27456340.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"150","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s27456340.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s27456340.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27456340.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/25977417\/","id":"25977417","publisher":"SitePoint","isbn10":"0992279437","isbn13":"9780992279431","title":"Jump Start Bootstrap","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/25977417","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 29.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bryan F.J.

中疯狂Java体系图书均已沉淀多年、赢得极高的市场认同、多次重印成为超级畅销图书，并被多所“985”“211”高校选作教材，不少图书已被翻译成繁体中文版， 授权到中国台湾地区。","summary":"本书基于《疯狂Ajax 讲义（第3 版）》部分升级而来，全书升级了HTML 5.1 支持的XMLHttpRequest，jQuery 升级到3.1。本书的重点是新加入的两个目前十分主流的前端框架：AngularJS 和Bootstrap。本书详细、全面地介绍了AngularJS 和Bootstrap 的知识，由于这两个框架是本书的重点，因此本书花了近400 多页来介绍它们的功能和用法，这部分内容独立出来完全可以作为AngularJS 和Bootstrap 的学习手册。\n《疯狂前端开发讲义——jQuery+AngularJS+Bootstrap前端开发实战》主要就是讲解jQuery 3.1、AngularJS 1.6、Bootstrap 3.3 这三个最常用的前端框架，并针对每个框架都提供了实用的案例，让读者理论联系实际。这部分内容是“疯狂软件教育中心”的标准讲义，既包含了实际前端开发的重点和难点，也融入了大量学习者的学习经验和感悟。笔者以丰富的授课经验为基础，在讲解时深入浅出，力求使读者真正掌握前端开发的精髓。\n《疯狂前端开发讲义——jQuery+AngularJS+Bootstrap前端开发实战》最后提供了两个综合性案例：图书管理系统和电子拍卖系统，这两个项目都综合利用了jQuery、AngularJS、Bootstrap 前端开发技术，并在后端采用了最流行、最规范的轻量级Java EE 架构：控制器层->业务逻辑层->数据持久化层。这两个案例对实际项目具有极好的指导价值和借鉴意义。案例既提供了IDE无关的、基于Ant 管理的项目源码，也提供了基于Eclipse IDE 的项目源码，最大限度地满足读者的需求。如果在阅读本书时遇到任何技术问题，都可登录http:\/\/www.crazyit.org 与本书庞大的读者群交流。\n《疯狂前端开发讲义——jQuery+AngularJS+Bootstrap前端开发实战》并非针对零基础的读者，本书不再包含HTML、CSS、JavaScript 相关知识，这些知识是阅读本书的基础。本书适合有初步HTML、CSS、JavaScript 基础的读者，或对企业应用前端开发不太熟悉的开发人员。如果您已经掌握本书上篇：《疯狂HTML 5\/CSS 3\/JavaScript 讲义》的内容，将非常适合阅读本书。","price":"79.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Randomization and Bootstrap Methods Using

An Introduction to Bootstrap Methods with Applications to R explores the practicality of this approach and successfully utilizes R to illustrate applications for the bootstrap and other resampling methods. This book provides a modern introduction to bootstrap methods for readers who do not have an extensive background in advanced mathematics. Emphasis throughout is on the use of bootstrap methods as an exploratory tool, including its value in variable selection and other modeling environments. The authors begin with a description of bootstrap methods and its relationship to other resampling methods, along with an overview of the wide variety of applications of the approach. Subsequent chapters offer coverage of improved confidence set estimation, estimation of error rates in discriminant analysis, and applications to a wide variety of hypothesis testing and estimation problems, including pharmaceutical, genomics, and economics. To inform readers on the limitations of the method, the book also exhibits counterexamples to the consistency of bootstrap methods. An introduction to R programming provides the needed preparation to work with the numerous exercises and applications presented throughout the book. A related website houses the book's R subroutines, and an extensive listing of references provides resources for further study. Discussing the topic at a remarkably practical and accessible level, An Introduction to Bootstrap Methods with Applications to R is an excellent book for introductory courses on bootstrap and resampling methods at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It also serves as an insightful reference for practitioners working with data in engineering, medicine, and the social sciences who would like to acquire a basic understanding of bootstrap methods.","price":"USD 118.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bradley Efron"],"pubdate":"1987-01-01","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"统计学","title":"统计学"},{"count":1,"name":"数学","title":"数学"},{"count":1,"name":"maths","title":"maths"},{"count":1,"name":"lang:en","title":"lang:en"},{"count":1,"name":"2018","title":"2018"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4006264.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"100","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4006264.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4006264.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4006264.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4070536\/","id":"4070536","publisher":"Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","isbn10":"0898711797","isbn13":"9780898711790","title":"The Jackknife, the Bootstrap, and Other Resampling Plans (CBMS-NSF Regional Conference Series in Applied Mathematics)","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4070536","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","series":{"id":"10402","title":"Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences"},"price":"USD 41.50"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Guide for Practitioners and Researchers","author":["Wiley"],"pubdate":"2007","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"计量经济学","title":"计量经济学"},{"count":1,"name":"经济学","title":"经济学"},{"count":1,"name":"科普","title":"科普"},{"count":1,"name":"数据处理","title":"数据处理"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3987381.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"369","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3987381.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3987381.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3987381.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3705089\/","id":"3705089","publisher":"Wiley","isbn10":"0471756210","isbn13":"9780471756217","title":"Bootstrap Methods","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3705089","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"A practical and accessible introduction to the bootstrap method--newly revised and updated\nOver the past decade, the application of bootstrap methods to new areas of study has expanded, resulting in theoretical and applied advances across various fields.

A Billion Bootstraps  unearths the roots of the microcredit revolution, revealing how the pioneering work of people such as Dr. Muhammad Yunus-winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize-is giving hope to billions. Philanthropist and self-made millionaire Phil Smith and microcredit expert and consultant Eric Thurman provide a riveting narrative that explores how these small loans, arranged by “barefoot bankers,” enable impoverished people to start small businesses, support their families, and improve local economies. By paying back their loans instead of simply accepting handouts, men and women around the world are continually giving others the same opportunity to change their futures.   Smith and Thurman also examine why traditional charity programs, while providing short-term relief, often perpetuate the problems they are trying to alleviate, and how applying investment principles to philanthropy is the key to reversing poverty permanently.    A Billion Bootstraps  explains how ordinary people can accelerate the microcredit movement by investing charitable donations in specific programs and then leveraging those contributions so the net cost to lift one person out of poverty is remarkably low. You'll discover how to get more for your money by donating with the mind-set of an investor and calculating measurable returns-returns that will change lives and societies forever.","price":"USD 24.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Jurik, Nancy C."],"pubdate":"2005-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19321544.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"270","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s19321544.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s19321544.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19321544.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2797757\/","id":"2797757","publisher":"Cornell Univ Pr","isbn10":"0801489970","isbn13":"9780801489976","title":"Bootstrap Dreams","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2797757","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 27.06"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Godfrey, Leslie"],"pubdate":"2009-9","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"统计学","title":"统计学"},{"count":1,"name":"科普","title":"科普"},{"count":1,"name":"数据处理","title":"数据处理"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7993670.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"344","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7993670.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7993670.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7993670.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4481050\/","id":"4481050","publisher":"","isbn10":"0230202306","isbn13":"9780230202306","title":"Bootstrap Tests for Regression Models","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4481050","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Modern computer systems are now so powerful that they can be used to carry out simulation-based statistical investigations without involving delays or the need to access high levels of equipment. When carrying out econometric analyses, the routine use of computer-based methods offers a valuable alternative to the standard approach in which approximations are based upon what happens as the sample size grows without limit. Applied work has to be based upon a finite number of observations. Computationally-intensive techniques and, in particular, bootstrap methods provide ways to improve the finite-sample performance of well-known tests. Bootstrap tests can also be employed when conventional theory does not lead to a test statistic, which can be compared with critical values from some standard distribution. This book uses the familiar linear regression model as a framework for introducing simulation-based tests to applied workers, students and others who carry out empirical econometric analyses.","price":"$ 129.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"50 Ways to Break Out, Take Charge, and Move Up","author":["Arneson, Steve"],"pubdate":"2010-4","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5587912.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"192","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5587912.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5587912.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5587912.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5308001\/","id":"5308001","publisher":"","isbn10":"1605093459","isbn13":"9781605093451","title":"Bootstrap Leadership","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5308001","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Leadership coach, consultant and keynote speaker Steve Arneson, named one of the country's top 25 leadership coaches by \"Leadership Excellence Magazine\", helps aspiring leaders overcome cutbacks in corporate training and \"pull themselves up\" the leadership ladder in 50 practical, tested tips. Leadership training can be inconsistent in the best of times and in tough economic times it's often one of the first things that even the most progressive companies cut back. Nor can you depend on finding that mentor you've been hoping for. So now more than ever, if you're going to advance your career you need to lift yourself up by your bootstraps.

She grew up in a family of physicists, scientists, and professors. She studied system analysis in the National University of Ukraine Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. At the age of 20, she moved to Portugal, where she did her bachelors' and masters' degrees in computer science from the University of Coimbra. During her studies, she participated in the research and development of European projects and became an assistant teacher of operating systems and computer graphics subjects. After obtaining her masters' degree, she started working at Feedzai. At that time, it was a small team of four, starting the development of a product from scratch, and now, it is one of the most successful Portuguese startups. At some point, her main responsibility became to develop a library written in JavaScript whose purpose was to bring data from the engine to the web interface. This marked Olga's main direction in tech: web development. At the same time, she continued her teaching practice, giving a course of professional web development to the local professional education center in Coimbra.\nIn 2013, along with her brother and her husband, she started an educational project based in Ukraine. This project's name is EdEra and it has grown up from a small platform of online courses into a big player at the Ukrainian educational system scene. Currently, EdEra is moving towards an international direction and preparing an awesome online course about IT. Don't miss it!\nIn 2014, Olga, with her husband and daughter, moved from Portugal to Berlin, where she started working at Meetrics as a frontend engineer and, after a year, became the team lead of an amazing team of frontend software developers. Currently Olga works in a fintech company called OptioPay as a lead frontend engineer.\nOlga is happily married to an awesome guy called Rui, who is also a software engineer. Rui studied with Olga at the university of Coimbra and worked with her at Feedzai. Olga has a smart and beautiful daughter, Taissa, a fluffy cat, Patusca, and two fluffiest chinchillas, Barabashka and Cheburashka.","summary":"In this book, we will build a full stack web application right from scratch up to its deployment.\nWe will start by building a small introduction application and then proceed to the creation of a fully functional, dynamic responsive web application called ProFitOro. In this application, we will build a Pomodoro timer combined with office workouts. Besides the Pomodoro timer and ProFitOro workouts will enable authentication and collaborative content management. We will explore topics such as Vue reactive data binding, reusable components, routing, and Vuex store along with its state, actions, mutations, and getters. We will create Vue applications using both webpack and Nuxt.js templates while exploring cool hot Nuxt.js features such as code splitting and server-side rendering. We will use Jest to test this application, and we will even revive some trigonometry from our secondary school!\nWhile developing the app, you will go through the new grid system of Bootstrap 4 along with Vue.js’ directives. We will connect Vuex store to the Firebase real-time database, data storage, and authentication APIs and use this data later inside the application’s reactive components. Finally, we will quickly deploy our application using the Firebase hosting mechanism.","price":"USD 35.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sturdivant, Lee\/ Blakley, Tim"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"323","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2422114\/","id":"2422114","publisher":"Independent Pub Group","isbn10":"0962163570","isbn13":"9780962163579","title":"The Bootstrap Guide to Medicinal Herbs in the Garden, Field & Marketplace","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2422114","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"24.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Villanueva, Victor"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2635752\/","id":"2635752","publisher":"Natl Council of Teachers","isbn10":"0814103774","isbn13":"9780814103777","title":"Bootstraps","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2635752","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"18.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Barbe, Philippe\/ Bertail, Patrice"],"pubdate":"1995-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7685280.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"244","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7685280.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7685280.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7685280.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2856914\/","id":"2856914","publisher":"Springer Verlag","isbn10":"0387944788","isbn13":"9780387944784","title":"The Weighted Bootstrap","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2856914","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This monograph presents an account of the asymptotic behaviour of the weighted bootstrap - a new and powerful statistical technique.

When carrying out econometric analyses, the routine use of computer-based methods offers a valuable alternative to the standard approach in which approximations are based upon what happens as the sample size grows without limit. Applied work has to be based upon a finite number of observations. Computationally-intensive techniques and, in particular, bootstrap methods provide ways to improve the finite-sample performance of well-known tests. Bootstrap tests can also be employed when conventional theory does not lead to a test statistic, which can be compared with critical values from some standard distribution. This book uses the familiar linear regression model as a framework for introducing simulation-based tests to applied workers, students and others who carry out empirical econometric analyses.","price":"$ 41.81"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Rao, Dileep"],"pubdate":"2010-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4891588.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"322","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4891588.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4891588.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4891588.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5309197\/","id":"5309197","publisher":"","isbn10":"0980047722","isbn13":"9780980047721","title":"Bootstrap to Billions","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5309197","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"From the stories of entrepreneurs who have built some of the world's great companies (such as the world's largest medical device company and the world's largest consumer electronics retailer),  Bootstrap to Billions  shows entrepreneurs how they too can control and build a huge business from scratch to create wealth and keep it.   There are many ways to failure, only a few to success.  Bootstrap to Billions  shows entrepreneurs and managers how to succeed by learning from 28 entrepreneurs who started and built some of the world's great companies.  Contrary to currently popular belief, entrepreneurs can bootstrap to success.  Bootstrap to Billions  shows entrepreneurs and managers how these business giants bootstrapped and used alternate financing options to grow. Most of them - about 80% - never got venture capital. These entrepreneurs found their best market, designed the right strategy, developed the organization culture and leadership, and reached the top with capital-efficient strategies to minimize the need for capital. Lack of money did not constrain their growth.

worldwide among geologists, marine scientists, and petroleum engineers, Gene Shinn sometimes seems a product of another century. Born in the Florida Keys, he attended the University of Miami on a music scholarship, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology. A U.S. national champion spearfisher, he worked as a salvage diver, becoming an expert in the use of dynamite underwater. A self-tutored field geologist for nearly 50 years, he made major geological findings that have significantly changed professional and academic knowledge of undersea oil reserves. Shinn helped invent technology for underwater core drilling, and more recently, he has studied the effects of transoceanic African dust on coral reefs, agriculture, and human health. He's even the basis for a character in a mystery novel. In Bootstrap Geologist Shinn enthusiastically shares the highs and lows of his remarkable life. Taking readers around the globe as well as below the ocean, he recounts the painstaking process of data gathering that can lead to paradigm-breaking discoveries. He emphasizes the importance of field science and pointedly addresses the use and abuse of scientific research and the emergence of market-funded research.","price":"USD 34.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Miller, Frederic P.; Vandome, Agnes F.; McBrewster, John"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s22051102.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"72","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s22051102.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s22051102.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s22051102.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/19238793\/","id":"19238793","publisher":"","isbn10":"6132912983","isbn13":"9786132912985","title":"Bootstrap Aggregating","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/19238793","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Surhone, Lambert M.; Tennoe, Mariam T.; Henssonow, Susan F."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s22054471.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"168","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s22054471.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s22054471.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s22054471.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/19242163\/","id":"19242163","publisher":"","isbn10":"6132955275","isbn13":"9786132955272","title":"Bootstrap Protocol","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/19242163","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sergey Akopkokhyants","Stephen Radford"],"pubdate":"2016-11-29","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29467413.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"404","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29467413.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29467413.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29467413.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/27061241\/","id":"27061241","publisher":"Packt Publishing","isbn10":"1785880810","isbn13":"9781785880810","title":"Learning Web Development with Bootstrap and Angular - Second Edition","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/27061241","alt_title":"","author_intro":"About the Author\nSergey Akopkokhyants is a software architect with more than 20 years of professional experience in designing and developing client and server-side applications.

Analysing climate data is an exciting challenge, which is increased by non-normal distributional shape, serial dependence, uneven spacing and timescale uncertainties. This book presents bootstrap resampling as a computing-intensive method able to meet the challenge. It shows the bootstrap to perform reliably in the most important statistical estimation techniques: regression, spectral analysis, extreme values and correlation.This book is written for climatologists and applied statisticians. It explains step by step the bootstrap algorithms (including novel adaptions) and methods for confidence interval construction. It tests the accuracy of the algorithms by means of Monte Carlo experiments. It analyses a large array of climate time series, giving a detailed account on the data and the associated climatological questions.“….comprehensive mathematical and statistical summary of time-series analysis techniques geared towards climate applications…accessible to readers with knowledge of college-level calculus and statistics.” (Computers and Geosciences)“A key part of the book that separates it from other time series works is the explicit discussion of time uncertainty…a very useful text for those wishing to understand how to analyse climate time series.”(Journal of Time Series Analysis)“…outstanding.

Challenging our established notions of knowledge work, collaboration, knowledge management, interoperability, hypertext, and groupware, Engelbart outlines a new more powerful paradigm, calling for an open foundational, cross-cutting knowledge architecture, endowed with certain key features � still largely missing from today's information technology paradigm � that can dramatically improve how people can work together to solve important problems. He ends with a call to action for end-user organizations, developers, and other stakeholders to collectively, strategically, proactively lead the way into this frontier.\n1a\nOriginally produced by Yuri Rubinsky with editing assistance by Christina Engelbart, as a keepsake tribute commemorating the 1995 SoftQuad Web Award presented to Doug at the World Wide Web conference in Boston that December, honoring his early and seminal contribution to the hypertext systems.

Engelbart's Law, the observation that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.","summary":"\"Bootstrapping\" analyzes the genesis of personal computing from both technological and social perspectives, through a close study of the pathbreaking work of one researcher, Douglas Engelbart. In his lab at the Stanford Research Institute in the 1960s, Engelbart, along with a small team of researchers, developed some of the cornerstones of personal computing as we know it, including the mouse, the windowed user interface, and hypertext. Today, all these technologies are well known, even taken for granted, but the assumptions and motivations behind their invention are not. \"Bootstrapping\" establishes Douglas Engelbart's contribution through a detailed history of both the material and the symbolic constitution of his system's human-computer interface in the context of the computer research community in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s. Engelbart felt that the complexity of many of the world's problems was becoming overwhelming, and the time for solving these problems was becoming shorter and shorter. What was needed, he determined, was a system that would augment human intelligence, co-transforming or co-evolving both humans and the machines they use. He sought a systematic way to think and organize this coevolution in an effort to discover a path on which a radical technological improvement could lead to a radical improvement in how to make people work effectively. What was involved in Engelbart's project was not just the invention of a computerized system that would enable humans, acting together, to manage complexity, but the invention of a new kind of human, \"the user.\" What he ultimately envisioned was a \"bootstrapping\" process by which those who actually invented the hardware and software of this new system would simultaneously reinvent the human in a new form. The book also offers a careful narrative of the collapse of Engelbart's laboratory at Stanford Research Institute, and the further translation of Engelbart's vision. It shows that Engelbart's ultimate goal of coevolution came to be translated in terms of technological progress and human adaptation to supposedly user-friendly technologies. At a time of the massive diffusion of the World Wide Web, \"Bootstrapping\" recalls the early experiments and original ideals that led to today's \"information revolution.\"","price":"USD 17.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Developing the foundations of 'Process Physics', a radical information-theoretic modelling of reality","author":["Chris Klinger"],"pubdate":"2010-07-22","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"南澳过程物理","title":"南澳过程物理"},{"count":1,"name":"二当家","title":"二当家"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4519077.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"348","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4519077.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4519077.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4519077.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5343473\/","id":"5343473","publisher":"VDM Verlag Dr. Müller","isbn10":"3639250095","isbn13":"9783639250091","title":"Bootstrapping Reality from the Limitations of Logic","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5343473","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 101.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Mooney, Christopher Z.\/ Duval, Robert D."],"pubdate":"1993-8","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19343544.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"80","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s19343544.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s19343544.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19343544.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4611226\/","id":"4611226","publisher":"","isbn10":"080395381X","isbn13":"9780803953819","title":"Bootstrapping","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4611226","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Bootstrapping, a computational nonparametric technique for 're-sampling', enables researchers to draw a conclusion about the characteristics of a population strictly from the existing sample rather than by making parametric assumptions about the estimator. Using real data examples from per capita personal income to median preference differences between legislative committee members and the entire legislature, Mooney and Duval discuss how to apply bootstrapping when the underlying sampling distribution of the statistics cannot be assumed normal, as well as when the sampling distribution has no analytic solution. In addition, they show the advantages and limitations of four bootstrap confidence interval methods: normal approximation, percentile, bias-corrected percentile, and percentile-t. The authors conclude with a convenient summary of how to apply this computer-intensive methodology using various available software packages.","price":"$

She and her husband of nineteen years have just called it quits, leaving her with serious cash-flow problems and a looming divorce. More broke than ever, Link makes a seemingly impossible resolution: to hang on to her century-old farmhouse in northern Michigan and continue to raise her three boys on well water and wood chopping and dirt. Armed with an unfailing sense of humor and three resolute accomplices, Link confronts blizzards and foxes, learns about Zen divorce and the best way to butcher a hog, dominates a zucchini-growing contest and wins a year’s supply of local bread, masters the art of bargain cooking, wrangles rampaging poultry, and withstands any blow to her pride in order to preserve the life she wants. \n\n With an infectious optimism that would put Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm to shame and a deep appreciation of the natural world, Link tells the story of how, over the course of one long year, she holds on to her sons, saves the farm from foreclosure, and finds her way back to a life of richness and meaning on the land she loves.","price":"$ 28.19"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Jackel, Karl-Heinz;

Armed with an unfailing sense of humor and three resolute accomplices, Link confronts blizzards and foxes, learns about Zen divorce and the best way to butcher a hog, dominates a zucchini-growing contest and wins a year’s supply of local bread, masters the art of bargain cooking, wrangles rampaging poultry, and withstands any blow to her pride in order to preserve the life she wants. \n\n With an infectious optimism that would put Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm to shame and a deep appreciation of the natural world, Link tells the story of how, over the course of one long year, she holds on to her sons, saves the farm from foreclosure, and finds her way back to a life of richness and meaning on the land she loves.","price":"$ 39.55"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Willy, Nethanel"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s22390144.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"52","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s22390144.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s22390144.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s22390144.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/19580322\/","id":"19580322","publisher":"","isbn10":"6137225011","isbn13":"9786137225011","title":"Bootstrapping","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/19580322","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"How to Import and Sell on Amazon","author":["Anthony Lee"],"pubdate":"2016-10-7","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29549990.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"190","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29549990.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29549990.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29549990.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/27145826\/","id":"27145826","publisher":"Reid & Wright Publishing","isbn10":"0997855312","isbn13":"9780997855319","title":"Bootstrapping E-commerce","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/27145826","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 9.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["杨旺功"],"pubdate":"2017-07-01","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/27090675\/","id":"27090675","publisher":"清华大学","isbn10":"7302470871","isbn13":"9787302470878","title":"BootstrapWeb设计与开发实战\/跨平台移动开发丛书","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/27090675","alt_title":"","author_intro":"\r杨旺功，男，毕业于重庆邮电大学，硕士。现任北京印刷学院设计艺术学院教师，主要研究方向是信息与交互设计产品创新设计，具有丰富的数字媒体交互产品设计和移动应用UI设计的教学经验。在数字化艺术与设计领域成果显著，发表多篇数字化艺术与设计的论文，对信息与交互设计有深入的研究。","summary":"","price":"69.0"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31578036.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31578036.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31578036.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31578036.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32687632\/","id":"32687632","publisher":"","isbn10":"1484197135","isbn13":"9781484197134","title":"Bootstrapped: How 75 Entrepreneurs Successfully Bootstrapped Their Startups and How You Can Too","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32687632","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This book is about you!It’s about giving you the motivation and the guidance you need to start your own business without having to raise millions in venture capital. It’s about giving you the confidence that you can succeed with your ideas by showing you how others, just like you, did it.It’s about showing you what business models have been proven successful by bootstrapping and to help you identify how to find your own ideas for a business.I have researched thousands of startups. I’m intrigued to learn how they did it and more importantly, how more people like you can follow in their success. Bootstrapped shares the stories of a carefully selected 75 startups and entrepreneurs from a variety of industries and backgrounds.While we often read about the Facebook’s and Google’s of the world, the vast majority (i.e. the 99+ %) of startups never raise any venture capital and yet they find ways to become profitable and succeed all the while getting to maintain complete control of their companies. Bootstrapped uncovers these hidden stories to show you that it’s all possible.The media and to an extent, our society, provide a false perception that in order to successfully start a business, you need to raise a lot of money. While this may be true for a small percentage of companies (i.e., the 1%) that require millions in startup capital to grow to $Billion companies, it is untrue for more than 99% of successful startups.In Bootstrapped, you will learn not only how these savvy entrepreneurs bootstrapped their businesses, but you’ll also learn how they came up with their ideas, the steps they took to transform their ideas into a business, and how they ultimately built and scaled their businesses to success.Let’s face it, most of us want to start our own business, but we often don’t know where to start. In fact, just getting started is the BIGGEST reason why most of us never do it. And there are 2 false ideas that we give ourselves that are the cause of our inability to START something great:1.) I don’t have a good idea2.) I don’t have enough moneyBootstrapped will show you that finding a “good” business idea is a lot easier than you think AND that you often don’t need a lot (if any) money to get started with your idea.Bootstrapped isn’t about selling you a pipe dream. It’s about showing you real life stories of how real life entrepreneurs did it, and more importantly, they show you how you can do it too.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform","author":["Ashley Davis"],"pubdate":"2020-6-4","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33510116.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"325","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s33510116.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s33510116.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33510116.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/34873816\/","id":"34873816","publisher":"Manning Publications","isbn10":"1617297216","isbn13":"9781617297212","title":"Bootstrapping Microservices","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/34873816","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Ashley Davis is a software developer, entrepreneur, author, and stock trader.
