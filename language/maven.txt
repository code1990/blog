Now there's help. The long-awaited official documentation to Maven is here. Written by Maven creator Jason Van Zyl and his team at Sonatype, Maven: The Definitive Guide clearly explains how this tool can bring order to your software development projects. Maven is largely replacing Ant as the build tool of choice for large open source Java projects because, unlike Ant, Maven is also a project management tool that can run reports, generate a project website, and facilitate communication among members of a working team. To use Maven, everything you need to know is in this guide. The first part demonstrates the tool's capabilities through the development, from ideation to deployment, of several sample applications -- a simple software development project, a simple web application, a multi-module project, and a multi-module enterprise project. The second part offers a complete reference guide that includes: * The POM and Project Relationships * The Build Lifecycle * Plugins * Project website generation * Advanced site generation * Reporting * Properties * Build Profiles * The Maven Repository * Team Collaboration * Writing Plugins * IDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, ands NetBeans * Using and creating assemblies * Developing with Maven Archetypes Several sources for Maven have appeared online for some time, but nothing served as an introduction and comprehensive reference guide to this tool -- until now. Maven: The Definitive Guide is the ideal book to help you manage development projects for software, web applications, and enterprise applications. And it comes straight from the source.","price":"USD 34.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Developer's Notebook","author":["Vincent Massol","Timothy M.

In terms of capabilities, Maven is an improvement to Apache Ant-thanks to numerous plug-ins and built-in integration with unit testing frameworks such as J Unit. Tired of writing the same build logic for every project? Using \"Maven\", you can leverage the experience of the community to avoid the tedious process of creating yet another build script for each new project. \"Maven: A Developer's Notebook\" begins by introducing you to the concept of project object model (POM), and then offers further details on the essential features of Maven. Like all titles in O'Reilly's \"Developer's Notebook\" series, this no-nonsense book skips the boring prose and cuts right to the chase. It's an approach that forces you to get your hands dirty by working through a series of poignant labs-exercises that speak to you instead of at you. \"Maven: A Developer's Notebook\" is the first book on the subject to hit the market, so you know the information is fresh and timely. If you're a Java programmer, you'll be armed with all the critical information you need to get up to speed on this powerful new build tool. You'll discover how Maven can help you: manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation, all from a central piece of information; break a complex project into a series of smaller subprojects; report on code quality, unit tests, code duplication, and project activity; create a custom remote repository; and build simple and complex plug-ins. In the end, you'll find yourself spending less time working on your project's build system and more time working on your project's code.","price":"USD 29.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Build and Manage Applications with Maven, Continuum, and Archiva","author":["Brett Porter","Maria Odea Ching"],"pubdate":"2009-9-15","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"Maven","title":"Maven"},{"count":1,"name":"计算机","title":"计算机"},{"count":1,"name":"技术","title":"技术"},{"count":1,"name":"开发","title":"开发"},{"count":1,"name":"java","title":"java"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4176909.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"456","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4176909.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4176909.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4176909.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4212375\/","id":"4212375","publisher":"Packt Publishing","isbn10":"1847194540","isbn13":"9781847194541","title":"Apache Maven 2 Effective Implementation","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4212375","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"By building up a sample application, this book guides developers painlessly through building a project with Maven.

Los Angeles welcomed her again, and with its embrace came a new husband and a new family. The long road from Reno grew longer as 1992 became 2000. But when Maven discovers that her new husband is keeping a secret, deceptions begin to unfold in the lives of a family that wants Maven gone. An overbearing mother-in-law, an ex-wife, and a stepdaughter become the players in a larger game of betrayal. And as her children make plans for college, Maven begins to realize that the life she had thought was in the past is now part of the present.Choices will rise up from her past to reclaim the present. And as the long road from Reno begins to close its distance, Maven understands that her actions are not without consequence. The past is never too far from the present, nor is betrayal too far from murder.

In the last few years, open source developers have created or significantly improved a host of Java XP tools, from XDoclet, Maven, AntHill, and Eclipse to Ant, JUnit, and Cactus. This practical, code-intensive guide shows you how to put these tools to work — and capitalize on the benefits of Extreme Programming.   \n\n   Using an example pet store application, our expert Java developers demonstrate how to harness the latest versions of Ant and XDoclet for automated building and continuous integration. They then explain how to automate the testing process using JUnit, Cactus, and other tools, and to enhance project management and continuous integration through Maven and AntHill. Finally, they show you how to work with XP tools in the new Eclipse IDE.   \n\n   Complete with real-world advice on how to implement the principles and practices of effective developers, this book delivers everything you need to harness the power of Extreme Programming in your own projects.   \n\n   What does this book cover?   \n\n   Here are some of the things you'll find out about in this book:    \n    \n    How to automate the building of J2EE apps and components with Ant and XDoclet    \n    Techniques for automating Java testing using JUnit    \n    Procedures for automating servlet, JSP, and other J2EE testing using Cactus    \n    Ways to automate Swing testing with Jemmy, JFCUnit, and Abbot    \n    How to manage projects using Maven    \n    Techniques for automating continuous integration with AntHill and Cruise Control    \n    How to harness plugins for JUnit, Cactus, and Ant in the Eclipse IDE    \n    Ways to implement Extreme Programming best practices       \n\n   \n\n   Who is this book for?   \n\n   This book is for enterprise Java developers who have a general familiarity with the XP methodology and want to put leading Java XP tools to work in the development process.","price":"USD 44.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Migrating Java, Spring, Hibernate and Maven Developers to Adobe Flex","author":["Filippo di Pisa"],"pubdate":"2010-01-06","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"Programming","title":"Programming"},{"count":1,"name":"Java","title":"Java"},{"count":1,"name":"Flex","title":"Flex"},{"count":1,"name":"CS","title":"CS"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4243671.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"444","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4243671.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4243671.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4243671.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3716558\/","id":"3716558","publisher":"Apress","isbn10":"1430223855","isbn13":"9781430223856","title":"Beginning Java and Flex","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3716558","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Over the past few years, the now-open source Adobe Flex framework has been adopted by the Java community as the preferred framework for Java rich Internet applications (RIAs) using Flash for the presentation layer.

collection of syndicated columns (previously published in the New York Times Magazine ) on grammar, etymology, and shades of meaning. Drawing material from politics and pop culture, Safire will please all lovers of language in his musings on usage and the origins of buzzwords. He struggles to keep his conservative politics out of these columns (not always successfully, since many of them appeared during the 1988 election), and he is sometimes cloyingly clever. But he is never obscure, and comments from readers (the \"Gotcha! Gang\")--as many as 15 letters are appended to each column--render the tone conversational, not dictatorial. Entry subjects range from \"Iron Curtain \" and \"kinder, gentler nation\" to \"winkle-picker\" and \"junk fax.\" Highly recommended for all collections. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 4\/1\/93.\n- Jack Lynch, Univ. of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia\nCopyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.\nFrom Kirkus Reviews\nMore delightful linguistic nit-picking from Safire. This seventh collection of the author's ``On Language'' columns (Language Maven Strikes Again, 1990, etc.), reprinted from The New York Times Magazine, finds him in fine and cranky fettle: Instead of an opening acknowledgments page, he gives us ``Credits,'' since ``Acknowledgments is a word that, to me, connotes grudging admission of the need to say thanks....Besides, the snooty word has a fake Latin prefix: hell with it.'' Although the columns cover scores of topics ranging from ``drug-war lingo'' to the phrase ``pushing the envelope'' and the idiosyncrasies of apostrophes, readers will note the regularity with which Safire tackles the utterances of George Bush--for example, the former President's description ``of a photo session at which he makes remarks but refuses to answer reporters' questions as `a limited photo op cum statement sans questions' ''). As in the earlier collections, much of the fun here comes from the many readers' responses to the columns--e.g., Leo Rosten, commenting on Safire's piece on political phrasing, remembering his own unsuccessful attempt, while at the RAND Corporation, to complement the word ``warfare'' with ``peacefare''; or the fellow from Pleasantville, New York, who answers Safire's column about misplaced plurals by citing the story of the Bronx woman who asked her daughter, Bella, for a ``Kleeneck'': ``Bella said, `Ma, it's Kleenex.' To which Ma replied, `Yeah, I know, but I only want one.' '' -- Copyright ©1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

That world is long dead, and customers now occupy that position. In this relentlessly globalizing economy, we live in a world of  oversupply  and  underdemand , with too many suppliers chasing too few customers, offering more goods and services than the market can absorb.\n\nNoel Capon set out to discover what differentiates people who know how to succeed in this changed world-people who are able to  create customers  for the products and services of their business.\n\n The Marketing Mavens  is based on a four-year-long research program that spanned twenty-five industries, identifying long-term winners and what they do differently. Put simply, Marketing Mavens place customers at the center of their business and make marketing  everyone’ s job. Using a wide variety of intriguing, in-depth examples, from ESPN to the Mayo Clinic, Dr. Capon shows how the mavens create customers. How by placing the sports fan at the center of its business, ESPN creates programming that meets the needs of fans that were never given a second thought by the networks; or how physicians at the Mayo Clinic, being both technical experts and skilled at creating a patient-centric ambience, motivate people to pay the extra travel and lodging expenses not covered by insurance.\n\nMarketing Mavens, though a rare breed, can be found up and down an organization-from the CEO to chief marketing officers to business unit managers. Noel Capon has talked to mavens from across the global economy and brings forth their uncanny insights behind the five imperatives of the true Marketing Maven:\n\n ¥ Picking markets that matter \n ¥ Selecting segments to dominate and finding the sweet spot in that segment \n ¥ Designing the offer to create customer value and secure differential advantage \n ¥ Integrating to serve the customer  \n ¥ And measuring what matters \n\nNoel Capon in  The   Marketing Mavens  redefines marketing, moving it from a focus on selling and communication into a discipline that guides all the key decisions of a business. By seeing marketing as everyone’s business-not the domain of a few specialists-you’ll get your business in step with the way the world really works . . . and start creating customers. Next year’s profits don’t depend on next year’s numbers but on next year’s customers.  The   Marketing Mavens  points the way to those customers, profits, and an increased stock price.","price":"USD 27.50"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Milind Parikh"],"pubdate":"2005-9-21","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27402345.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"700","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s27402345.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s27402345.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27402345.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10178735\/","id":"10178735","publisher":"APress,US","isbn10":"1590595211","isbn13":"9781590595213","title":"Pro Apache Maven","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10178735","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"\"Pro Apache Maven is the first and only book on Pro Apache Maven, a cooperative software development.

Now, even beginner quilters can perfect paper piece with pizzazz. The days of awkward pieces of paper held up to the light are over. With the paper-folding method, that's no longer necessary, and with paper foundations, the accuracy of those sharp points is assured. The instructions for Perfect Paper Piecing are given in detail and generously illustrated in photos. Plus, the accompanying pattern CD contains all patterns at full size, allowing you to print as many as you need, without worrying about distortion from the copy machine. Quilters can begin by making a pillowcase or playful placemat. Once they experience this easy and fast method, they can, with confidence, try one of the quilt patterns taught by the QuiltMavens in their beginning classes - pieces such as Aaron's quilt, Day at the Beach, or Whirligig. Raspberry Sorbet is the most playful of the group. These quilts look complex but go together very quickly. Then comes what the authors call 'Extreme Spiking.' These are blocks that have been skewed into new shapes. Because paper foundation piecing is so accurate, these unusual blocks go together nearly as easily as more traditional blocks. Compatible with Windows and Mac.","price":"$ 28.19"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Barer, Shoshana"],"pubdate":"2004-11","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6582739.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"144","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6582739.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6582739.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6582739.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6581431\/","id":"6581431","publisher":"","isbn10":"0975435493","isbn13":"9780975435496","title":"The Jewish MAVEN On EVERYTHING A To Z! \"Let Me Tell You A Story!\"","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6581431","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"THE JEWISH MAVEN ON EVERYTHING A TO Z  ENOUGH SCHMALTZ TO WARM THE HEARTS OF READERS PLUS THE HUMOR, WARMTH, WISDOM AND ANSWERS TO EVERYTHING MEN AND WOMEN WANT TO KNOW  The Jewish MAVEN is a witty, wise, philosophical, beautiful woman who is an Expert on Everything A To Z  Look for the trailer on www.sablepublishing.com and film festivals world wide.

In some ways the threat has grown worse: The 9\/11 hijackers came from far away; the danger today can come from anywhere—from the other side of the world to across the street. Unable to stem recruitment, we seem doomed to a worsening struggle with a constantly evolving enemy that remains several steps ahead of us. Unfortunately, current policies seem almost guaranteed not to reduce extremist violence but instead to make it easier for terrorists to spread their hateful ideas, recruit new members, and carry out attacks.We actually possess the means right now to inoculate communities against extremist ideologies. In How We Win, Farah Pandith presents a revolutionary new analysis of global extremism as well as powerful but seldom-used strategies for vanquishing it. Drawing on her visits to eighty countries, the hundreds of interviews and focus groups she’s conducted around the world, and her high-level experience in the Bush and Obama administrations, Pandith argues for a paradigm shift in our approach to combat extremism, one that mobilizes the expertise and resources of diplomats, corporate leaders, mental health experts, social scientists, entrepreneurs, local communities, and, most of all, global youth themselves.There is a war being fought, and we can win it.
