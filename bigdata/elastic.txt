fluid layouts change width based on the user's unique device viewing size. These types of layouts have always been possible with tables but offer new design challenges as well as opportunities when built with CSS. This book, for experienced Web designers with some CSS experience, outlines how to do this successfully.  Designers will learn the benefits of flexible layouts and when to choose a liquid, elastic, or hybrid design. They will learn not only how to build a liquid layout from scratch using standards-compliant and cross-browser compatible (X)HTML and CSS, but will also learn how to design and slice their graphic comps in a way that makes flexible design achievable. This book will show designers that flexible layouts do not have to be visually boring or difficult to build when planned and built correctly. Even those who do not intend to build liquid layouts can use the concepts and techniques taught in this book to improve their fixed-width CSS designs, because they will learn how to design for the inherent flexibility of the web medium, instead of the rigid qualities of print media or table grid-based layouts.","price":"USD 44.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Elastic Compute Cloud and Web Services Development  with Java","author":["Max Yankelevich","Mikhail Malamud","Donald Mahaya"],"pubdate":"2009-12-17","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"cloud","title":"cloud"},{"count":2,"name":"Web","title":"Web"},{"count":2,"name":"Amazon","title":"Amazon"},{"count":1,"name":"Service","title":"Service"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4260325.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"400","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4260325.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4260325.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4260325.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4104853\/","id":"4104853","publisher":"Apress","isbn10":"1430224479","isbn13":"9781430224471","title":"Pro Amazon EC2 and WS","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4104853","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Cloud computing is being talked about as the next major trend that is going to change the way businesses use technology to gain competitive advantage in the marketplace, much like the Internet did in the 1990s.

Either they collapsed in chaos, or society returned to commodity money before that could happen. Drawing upon novel new research,  Paper Money Collapse  conclusively illustrates why paper money systems—those based on an elastic and constantly expanding supply of money as opposed to a system of commodity money of essentially fixed supply—are inherently unstable and why they must lead to economic disintegration. These highly controversial conclusions clash with the present consensus, which holds that elastic state money is superior to inflexible commodity money (such as a gold standard), and that expanding money is harmless or even beneficial for as long as inflation stays low. Contradicting this,  Paper Money Collapse  shows that: The present crisis is the unavoidable result of continuously expanding fiat money  The current policy of accelerated money production to \"stimulate\" the economy is counterproductive and could lead to a complete collapse of the monetary system  Why many in financial markets, in media, and in the policy establishment are unable (and often unwilling) to fully appreciate the underlying problems with elastic money  This compelling new book looks at the breakdown of modern economic theory and the fallacy of mathematical models. It is an analysis of the current financial crisis and shows in very stark terms that the solutions presented by paper money-enthusiasts around the world are misguided and inherently flawed.","price":"USD 39.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Mindlin, R.

It systematically derives the two-dimensional theories of anisotropic elastic plates from the variational formulation of the three-dimensional theory of elasticity by power series expansions. The uniqueness of two-dimensional problems is also examined from the variational viewpoint. The accuracy of the two-dimensional equations is judged by comparing the dispersion relations of the waves that the two-dimensional theories can describe with prediction from the three-dimensional theory. Discussing mainly high-frequency dynamic problems, it is also useful in traditional applications in structural engineering as well as provides the theoretical foundation for acoustic wave devices.","price":"$ 88.14"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Elastic, Inelastic, Fracture, and Damage Theories","author":["Zdenek P.

This book aims to present an account of the theory of wave propagation in elastic solids. The material is arranged to present an exposition of the basic concepts of mechanical wave propagation within a one-dimensional setting and a discussion of formal aspects of elastodynamic theory in three dimensions, followed by chapters expounding on typical wave propagation phenomena, such as radiation, reflection, refraction, propagation in waveguides, and diffraction. The treatment necessarily involves considerable mathematical analysis. The pertinent mathematical techniques are, however, discussed at some length.","series":{"id":"24894","title":"North-Holland Series in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics"},"price":"USD 88.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Reddy, J.

Compiling this information into a single volume, \"Theory and Analysis of Elastic Plates and Shells, Second Edition\" presents a complete, up-to-date, and unified treatment of classical and shear deformation plates and shells, from the basic derivation of theories to analytical and numerical solutions. Revised and updated, this second edition incorporates new information in most chapters, along with some rearrangement of topics to improve the clarity of the overall presentation. The book presents new material on the theory and analysis of shells, featuring an additional chapter devoted to the topic. The author also includes new sections that address Castigliano's theorems, axisymmetric buckling of circular plates, the relationships between the solutions of classical and shear deformation theories, and the nonlinear finite element analysis of plates. The book provides many illustrations of theories, formulations, and solution methods, resulting in an easy-to-understand presentation of the topics. Like the previous edition, this book remains a suitable textbook for a course on plates and shells in aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering curricula and continues to serve as a reference for industrial and academic structural engineers and scientists.","price":"$ 135.54"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Graff, Karl F."],"pubdate":"1991-6","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"1","title":"1"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6346447.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"688","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6346447.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6346447.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6346447.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4610096\/","id":"4610096","publisher":"","isbn10":"0486667456","isbn13":"9780486667454","title":"Wave Motion in Elastic Solids","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4610096","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Comprehensive, self-contained coverage of a variety of topics ranges from the elementary theory of waves and vibrations in strings to three-dimensional theory of waves in thick plates.

G. Harris intended to explain in this book the special techniques required to model the radiation and diffraction of elastic and surface waves. Sadly, he died before he could fulfil this ambition, but his plan has been brought to fruition by a team of his distinguished collaborators. The book begins with the basic underlying equations for wave motion and then builds upon this foundation by solving a number of fundamental scattering problems. The remaining chapters provide a thorough introduction to modern techniques that have proven essential to understanding radiation and diffraction at high frequencies. Graduate students, researchers and professionals in applied mathematics, physics and engineering will find that the chapters increase in complexity, beginning with plane-wave propagation and spectral analyses. Other topics include elastic wave theory, the Wiener–Hopf technique, the effects of viscosity on acoustic diffraction, and the phenomenon of channelling of wave energy along guided structures.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31886409.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31886409.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31886409.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31886409.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32996276\/","id":"32996276","publisher":"","isbn10":"133204977X","isbn13":"9781332049776","title":"A Theoretical and Practical Treatise on the Strength of Beams and Columns: In Which the Ultimate and the Elastic Limit Strength of Beams and Columns Is Computed from the Ultimate and Elastic Limit Compressive and Tensile Strength of the Material, by Means","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32996276","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Excerpt from A Theoretical and Practical Treatise on the Strength of Beams and Columns: In Which the Ultimate and the Elastic Limit Strength of Beams and Columns Is Computed From the Ultimate and Elastic Limit Compressive and Tensile Strength of the Material, by Means of Formulas Deduced From the Correct, and New Theory of the Transverse Str Bending Moment - Concentrated Forces General Formulas for Bending Moments, Uniformly Varying Forces Rectangular Areas, Resultant.

Emphasis is placed upon simplicity of analysis without compromising the accuracy of results and a large number of examples are included for illustration. These also provide help for users of the easy-to-use software included. The fully-revised software runs smoothly under current Windows operating systems. Employing the numerical techniques outlined in the book, this powerful tool makes design analysis of the related structures easy and time-efficient. The applicability of the software is extended to analysis of laterally-loaded piles and bending analysis of retaining walls. A bonus suite of complementary software containing programmes for elastic-plastic soil-structure interaction analyses of beams\/strips, laterally-loaded piles\/sheet-piles, and long retaining walls is also included. The book and software are of the greatest interest and use to practising engineers engaged in design of beams, strips, circular plates, circular-cylindrical tanks and silos. Postgraduate students and researchers working in the soil-structure interaction area should also find the book-software package of great value.

Ferroelasticity, twinning and related microstructures are described. Landau-type theories of phase transitions are introduced, together with details of elastic and specific heat anomalies, the formation of spontaneous strain, and the generation of solitary waves at temperatures close to the transition point. Many materials used in industry are crystals. These crystals often show anomalies such as sudden softening or embrittlement at certain temperatures; if controlled, such behaviour can be extremely useful for manufacturing and high technology applications. This is one of the first books to describe the recently determined physical origins of such behaviour, and provides an insight into the important thermodynamic principles and microstructural properties involved.","price":"$ 65.54"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Jose Pujol"],"pubdate":"2003-07-14","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3384964.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"462","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3384964.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3384964.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3384964.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3319002\/","id":"3319002","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","isbn10":"0521817307","isbn13":"9780521817301","title":"Elastic Wave Propagation and Generation in Seismology","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3319002","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Seismology has complementary observational and theoretical components, and a thorough understanding of the observations requires a sound theoretical background.

The text includes student exercises (with hints), for which solutions are available on a dedicated website. This website also contains numerous downloadable programs for the computation of reflection and transmission coefficients, for the generation of P and S wave radiation patterns and synthetic seismograms, in infinite media. This book will therefore find a receptive audience among advanced undergraduate and graduate students interested in developing a solid mathematical background to tackle more advanced topics in seismology.

Methods of analysis of Beams on Elastic Foundation are not limited to the area of Civil-Structural Engineering. These methods are used in various areas of Mechanical and Geotechnical Engineering as well. Analysis of beams on elastic foundation is performed currently by using special computer programs based on numerical methods, such as Finite Difference Method and Finite Element Method. However, these programs are not always available, and their application is limited. Most of computer programs are developed only for Winkler's soil model. They cannot be used for other soil models such as Elastic Half-Space or Elastic Layer and others. Methods of analysis of complex beams, such as stepped beams, pin-connected beams, beams with various boundary conditions are not developed for practical applications. Hand calculations based on Method of End Conditions (Method Hetenyi) or Method of Initial Parameters are very laborious, time consuming and usually impossible to use. Consequently, a practicing engineer has no other option, but to perform hand calculations of any beam on Elastic Foundation as absolutely rigid, without taking into account the actual rigidity of the beam. While this method, in some cases, can be justified, it can also lead to serious mistakes. This book contains tables that allow analyzing various free supported beams on Winkler Foundation. The same tables are used for analysis of complex problems, such as stepped beams, pin-connected beams, interconnected beams, and any other continuous beams with various boundary conditions. This book includes also practical recommendations for analysis of beams and frames on Winkler Foundation by replacing the soil with elastic supports and individual foundations with line elements that allows using programs for analysis of statically indeterminate systems to analyze various beams and frames supported on Elastic Foundation. A significant part of this book is devoted to the Method of Initial Parameters and its application to analysis of Beams and Frames on Elastic Foundation . A computer program, based on this method, allows performing computer analysis of Beams on Elastic Foundation. Stiffness Method is used for combined analysis of frames with continuous foundations. Author takes into account the absolutely rigid elements at the area of intersection of the first floor columns and continuous foundations that significantly specifies the results of analysis. Stiffness Method is also applied to analysis of a system of interconnected beams supported on Winkler Foundation. Proposed method of analysis takes into account the absolutely rigid elements located at the area of beam intersection. The same method is used for analysis of a system of individual foundations connected with grade beams. Numerical examples illustrate application of the described method to practical analysis. A large part of this book is devoted to analysis of Beams and Frames on Elastic Half-Space. A numerical Method proposed by Zshemochkin is further developed and applied to analysis of beams with various boundary conditions and various soil models. Several numerical examples illustrate application of themethod to practical analysis. This book includes also tables developed by Simvulidi that allow analyzing beams supported on Elastic Half-Space. Tables are developed for three types of loads: concentrated vertical loads, moments, and uniformly distributed loads. Application of the tables is also illustrated with a series of numerical examples. Methods of combined analysis of 2D and 3D frames and foundations, described in this book, are relatively simple and produce more accurate results compared to separate analyses of frames and foundations. They allow performing analysis of the system Frame-Foundation using computer programs developed for analysis of regular statically indeterminate systems. While the book does not cover directly analysis of mat foundations, the tables, presented in this book, can, nonetheless, be used for simplified analysis of mats by cutting off bands from the mat in both directions and analyzing each band as a beam supported on Winkler Foundation or on Elastic Half-Space. The primary purpose of this book is to serve the practicing civil and structural engineer, but some parts of the book can also be of outmost interest to graduate students and teachers conducting research in area of structures supported on Elastic Foundation.","price":"$ 29.32"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Magrab, E.

It begins with fundamental aspects of stability, relating the basic notions of dynamic stability to more traditional quasi-static approaches. The book is concerned not only with buckling, or linear instability, but most importantly with nonlinear post-buckling behavior and imperfection-sensitivity. After laying out the general theory, Koiter applies the theory to a number of applications, with a chapter devoted to each. These include a variety of beam, plate, and shell structural problems and some basic continuum elasticity problems. Koiter's classic results on the nonlinear buckling and imperfection-sensitivity of cylindrical and spherical shells are included. The treatments of both the fundamental aspects and the applications are completely self contained. This book was recorded as a detailed set of notes by Arnold van der Heijden from W. T. Koiter's last set of lectures on stability theory, at TU Delft.","price":"$ 164.98"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Granzier, Henk; Pollack, Gerald H.; Granzier, H.

Titin was discovered initially in muscle cells, where it interconnects the thick filament with the Z-line. Titin forms a molecular spring that is responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of contracting muscle, ensuring efficient muscle contraction. More recently, it has become clear that titin is not restricted to muscle cells alone. For example, titin is found in chromosomes of neurons and also in blood platelets. This topic is fast becoming a focal point for research in understanding viscoelastic properties at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels. In titin may lie a generic basis for biological viscoelasticity. It has become clear that titin may hold the key to certain clinical anomalies. For example, it is clear that titin-based ventricular stiffness is modulated by calcium and that titin is responsible for the altered stiffness in cardiomyopathies. It is also clear from evidence from a group of Finnish families that titin mutations may underlie some muscular dystrophies and that with other mutations chromatids fail to separate during mitosis. Thus, it is clear that this protein will have important clinical implications stemming from its biomechanical role. One aspect of this field is the bringing together of bioengineers with clinical researchers and biologists. Genetic and biochemical aspects of titin-related proteins are being studied together with front-line engineering approaches designed to measure the mechanics of titin either in small aggregates or in single molecules.","price":"USD 275.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Johnson, Barbara"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"192","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2887720\/","id":"2887720","publisher":"Baker Pub Group","isbn10":"0800758595","isbn13":"9780800758592","title":"Fresh Elastic for Stretched Out Moms","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2887720","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"12.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Barbara Johnson"],"pubdate":"1985-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7739987.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7739987.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7739987.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7739987.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3368179\/","id":"3368179","publisher":"","isbn10":"0800752031","isbn13":"9780800752033","title":"Fresh Elastic for Stretched-Out Moms","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3368179","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Product Description  Her oldest son was killed in Vietnam. Five years later， to the day， another son died in a head-on car collision. Then another son， a practicing homosexual， left home and didn't tell his family where he went. This may not sound like the life of a woman known for bringing joy and laughter to others-but it is. That's Barbara Johnson's story.  \tFresh Elastic for Stretched Out Moms is for all parents whose hearts have been broken by their children. Johnson understands the hopelessness that they experience when children choose a rebellious lifestyle， sever a relationship， commit suicide， are seriously injured， are caught in an addiction， or engage in any other hurtful behavior. With compassion， understanding， and humor intact， she gently leads readers through a \"year of recovery\" to a fresh， hope-filled start.   \tThrough anecdotes， poems， jokes， poignant stories， and letters， readers will capture Johnson's infectious enthusiasm for life and learn to trust God for victory over depression and despair. Fresh Elastic for Stretched Out Moms will also prepare parents to uplift others who are in need of courage， love， laughter， and hope-just as Barbara Johnson continues to do. This second edition of her first-ever book contains a new preface by the author.  --This text refers to the Paperback edition.

The Elastic Closet examines the interconnected realms of law (from legal discrimination under Vichy to anti-hate speech legislation in 2004), politics (from the homophiles of the 1950s to distinctly French articulations of queer radicalism now) and the media (from postwar journals like Arcadie to Tetu and PinkTV today), with a focus on the relationship between French republican values and the possibilities they have offered for change in each of these three spheres.

The third volume is dedicated to propagation of plane, spherical and cylindrical elastic waves in different media including isotropic and transversely isotropic solids, liquid-solid models, and media with cylindrical inclusions (boreholes). This book contains the prevalence of physical reasoning on formal mathematical derivations. Readers do not need to have a strong background in mathematics and mathematical physics. It presents detailed analysis of wave phenomena in various types of elastic and liquid-elastic media.","price":"$ 242.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Royer, Daniel\/ Dieulesaint, E."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21579812.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"396","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s21579812.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s21579812.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21579812.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4509536\/","id":"4509536","publisher":"","isbn10":"3540659323","isbn13":"9783540659327","title":"Elastic Waves in Solids 1","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4509536","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"1305.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Pujol, Jose"],"pubdate":"2003-6","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7095469.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"462","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7095469.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7095469.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7095469.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4516867\/","id":"4516867","publisher":"","isbn10":"0521520460","isbn13":"9780521520461","title":"Elastic Wave Propagation and Generation in Seismology","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4516867","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Seismology has complementary observational and theoretical components, and a thorough understanding of the observations requires a sound theoretical background. This book bridges the gap between introductory textbooks and advanced monographs by providing the necessary mathematical tools and demonstrating how to apply them. Each seismological problem is carefully formulated and its solution is derived in a step-by-step approach. The text includes student exercises (with hints), for which solutions are available on a dedicated website. This website also contains numerous downloadable programs for the computation of reflection and transmission coefficients, for the generation of P and S wave radiation patterns and synthetic seismograms, in infinite media. This book will therefore find a receptive audience among advanced undergraduate and graduate students interested in developing a solid mathematical background to tackle more advanced topics in seismology. It will also form a useful reference volume for researchers wishing to brush up on the fundamentals.","price":"$ 108.48"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Shlyannikov, Valery N."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21570284.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"256","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s21570284.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s21570284.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21570284.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4517807\/","id":"4517807","publisher":"","isbn10":"3540443169","isbn13":"9783540443162","title":"Elastic-Plastic Mixed-Mode Fracture Criteria and Parameters","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4517807","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"1440.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Zhong-lin Wang"],"pubdate":"1995-3-31","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4640997.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"448","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4640997.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4640997.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4640997.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5985093\/","id":"5985093","publisher":"Springer","isbn10":"0306449293","isbn13":"9780306449291","title":"Elastic and Inelastic Scattering in Electron Diffraction and Imaging","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5985093","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This unique volume provides comprehensive coverage of the theories and techniques of elastic and inelastic electron diffraction and imaging as well as their applications in quantitative structure determination using transmission and scanning transmission electron microscopy.

infrastructures in many countries has been in service for many years and continues to be used. Due to a variety of physical, chemical, and environmental processes, concrete structures as well as other civil structures may get deteriorated or damaged in unexpected way. Therefore, structural health monitoring (SHM) of these structures to provide the necessary maintenance has become critically important to our society and is an emerging technology in civil engineering. Especially nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques that can detect and localize of damage in the structure or assess the current condition of the structure are desired to develop for successful applications of SHM. The research detailed in this book has complimentary efforts that seek to develop the NDE techniques for concrete structures using Rayleigh wave. Those include analytical and numerical study of Rayleigh wave propagation in solid media and development of strength gain and crack depth monitoring method in concrete structures.

There were over fifty presentations including four plenary sessions and poster sessions. The papers cover contemporary topics in multiscale modeling and characterization of materials behavior of engineering materials. These were selected to focus on topics related to deformation and failure in metals, alloys, intermetallics and polymers including: Experimental techniques, deformation and failure mechanisms, dislocation-based modeling, microscopic-macroscopic averaging schemes, application to forming processes and to phase transformation, localization and failure phenomena, and computational advances. Key areas that are covered by some of the papers include modeling of material deformation at various scales. At the atomistic scale, results from MD simulations pertaining to deformation mechanisms in nano-crystalline materials as well as dislocation-defect interactions are presented.  Advances in modeling of deformation in metals using discrete dislocation analyses are also presented, providing an insight into this emerging scientific technique that can be used to model deformation at the microscale. These papers address current engineering problems, including deformation of thin films, dislocation behaviour and strength during nanoindentation, strength in metal matrix composites, dislocation-crack interaction, development of textures in polycrystals, and problems involving twining and shape memory behavior.","price":"$ 258.77"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bolotin, V.V."],"pubdate":"2010-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7611614.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"484","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7611614.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7611614.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7611614.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10339364\/","id":"10339364","publisher":"","isbn10":"9048182808","isbn13":"9789048182800","title":"Random Vibrations of Elastic Systems","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10339364","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 450.87"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bremer, Hartmut"],"pubdate":"2010-11","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8811682.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"464","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8811682.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8811682.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8811682.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10330989\/","id":"10330989","publisher":"","isbn10":"9048179505","isbn13":"9789048179503","title":"Elastic Multibody Dynamics","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10330989","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This textbook is an introduction to and exploration of a number of core topics in the field of applied mechanics. On the basis of Lagrange's Principle, a Central Equation of Dynamics is presented which yields a unified view on existing methods. From these, the Projection Equation is selected for the derivation of the motion equations of holonomic and of non-holonomic systems.  The method is applied to rigid multibody systems where the rigid body is defined such that, by relaxation of the rigidity constraints, one can directly proceed to elastic bodies. A decomposition into subsystems leads to a minimal representation and to a recursive representation, respectively, of the equations of motion.  Applied to elastic multibody systems one obtains, along with the use of spatial operators, a straight-on procedure for the interconnected partial and ordinary differential equations and the corresponding boundary conditions. The spatial operators are eventually applied to a RITZ series for approximation. The resulting equations then appear in the same structure as in rigid multibody systems.  The main emphasis is laid on methodical as well as on (graduate level) educational aspects.  The text is accompanied by a large number of examples and applications, e.g., from rotor dynamics and robotics. The mathematical prerequisites are subsumed in a short excursion into stability and control.","price":"$ 213.57"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Kalker, J.J."],"pubdate":"2010-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7610688.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"344","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7610688.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7610688.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7610688.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10330805\/","id":"10330805","publisher":"","isbn10":"9048140668","isbn13":"9789048140664","title":"Three-Dimensional Elastic Bodies in Rolling Contact","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10330805","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 315.27"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Zubov, Leonid M."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8798518.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"211","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8798518.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8798518.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8798518.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10314378\/","id":"10314378","publisher":"","isbn10":"364208298X","isbn13":"9783642082986","title":"Nonlinear Theory of Dislocations and Disclinations in Elastic Bodies","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10314378","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 90.34"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"v. 2","author":["Guran, A."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10597748\/","id":"10597748","publisher":"","isbn10":"9810229658","isbn13":"9789810229658","title":"Acoustic Interactions with Submerged Elastic Structures","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10597748","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Kurtz, S.

This important book presents cutting-edge techniques and findings from research sources not generally accessible by Western researchers and engineers, aiding the application and further development of this potentially important technology. Beginning with an introduction to drag reduction that places the authors' work on elastic surfaces and combined techniques in context, the book moves on to provide a comprehensive study of drag reduction through elastic coating with both flow and material properties considered. Coverage includes: experimental findings around coherent vortical structures (CVS) in turbulent boundary layers and methods of controlling them; static and dynamic mechanical characteristics of elastic composite coatings, as well as new techniques and devices developed for their measurement; and, combined methods of flow control and drag reduction, including the effect of injection of polymer solutions, elastic coatings and generated longitudinal vortical structures on hydrodynamic resistance. Intended as a reference for senior engineers and researchers concerned with the drag reduction and the dynamics of turbulent boundary layer flows, \"Boundary Layer Flow over Elastic Surfaces\" provides a unique source of information on compliant surface drag reduction and the experimental techniques around it that have shown measurable and repeatable improvements over recent years. This compilation of research findings and new techniques developed for measurement will aid R&D engineers, naval architects and senior designers in their quest to achieve drag reductions that will deliver significant efficiency savings. This book provides: unique source of information on compliant surface drag reduction - an important area of technology with practical application to ships - from otherwise inaccessible research studies; and, updates the knowledge-base on boundary layer flow and surface friction reduction, critical topics in the global quest for increased ship efficiency and fuel economy.

While these processes are often very complex, one way to begin to understand them is to study wave propagation in the linear approximation. This is a book describing such propagation using, as a context, the equations of elasticity. Two unifying themes are used. The first is that an understanding of plane wave interactions is fundamental to understanding more complex wave interactions. The second is that waves are best understood in an asymptotic approximation where they are free of the complications of their excitation and are governed primarily by their propagation environments. The topics covered include reflection, refraction, the propagation of interfacial waves, integral representations, radiation and diffraction, and propagation in closed and open waveguides. Linear Elastic Waves is an advanced level textbook directed at applied mathematicians, seismologists, and engineers.","price":"$ 63.28"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Carroll, W.

A Primer for Finite Elements in Elastic Structures disassembles the entire finite element method for civil engineering students and professionals, detailing its supportive theory and its mathematical and structural underpinnings, in the context of elastic structures and the principle of virtual work.  The book opens with a discussion of matrix algebra and algebraic equation systems to foster the basic skills required to successfully understand and use the finite element method. Key mathematical concepts outlined here are joined to pertinent concepts from mechanics and structural theory, with the method constructed in terms of one-dimensional truss and framework finite elements. The use of these one-dimensional elements in the early chapters promotes better understanding of the fundamentals. Subsequent chapters describe many two-dimensional structural finite elements in depth, including the geometry, mechanics, transformations, and mapping needed for them.  Most chapters end with questions and problems which review the text material. Answers for many of these are at the end of the book. An appendix describes how to use MATLAB(r), a popular matrix-manipulation software platform necessary to perform the many matrix operations required for the finite element method, such as matrix addition, multiplication, inversion, partitioning, rearrangement, and assembly. As an added extra, the m-files discussed can be downloaded from the Wiley FTP server.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Kiral, Erhan; Kiral, E.; Eringen, A.

The book is intended for an audience with a knowledge of advanced calculus and some familiarity with functional analysis. It is a valuable resource for professionals in pure and applied mathematics, and for theoretical physicists and mechanical engineers whose work involves elastic plates.

Due to limitations on their weights, the elements themselves must be highly flexible, and due to limitations on their initial configuration (i.e., before deployment), those aggregates often have to contain several links so that the substructure may be unfolded or telescoped once it is deployed. The defining philosophy of this monograph is that in order to understand completely the dynamic response of such a complex elastic structure, it is not sufficient to consider only its global motion but also necessary to take into account the flexibility of individual elements and the interaction and transmission of elastic effects such as bending, torsion, and axial deformations at junctions where members are connected to each other. Therefore, the purposes of this monograph are: to derive distributed parameter models of the transient behavior of some or all of the state and interval variables which describe the dynamic response of multiple-link flexible structures such as trusses, frames, robot arms, solar panels, antennae and deformable mirrors, based on the principles of continuum mechanics and under reasonable constraints on the geometry of the admissible deformations; to provide rigorous mathematical analyses of the resulting models; and to develop control theoretic properties of multiple-link flexible structures based on the control theoretic properties of the models. The modelling and analysis of these complicated and realistic structural configurations should be of interest to a diverse group of applied mathematicians, structural, aeronautical, aerospace, and mechanical engineers and to advanced graduate students working on such problems.","price":"$ 111.87"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["New Holland

Professor Slawinski has the copyright to the textbook and the second edition is significantly extended. The present book emphasizes the interdependence of mathematical formulation and physical meaning in the description of seismic phenomena. Herein, we use aspects of continuum mechanics, wave theory and ray theory to explain phenomena resulting from the propagation of seismic waves. The book is divided into three main sections: elastic continua, waves and rays and variational formulation of rays. There is also a fourth part, which consists of appendices. In Part 1, we use continuum mechanics to describe the material through which seismic waves propagate, and to formulate a system of equations to study the behaviour of such a material. In Part 2, we use these equations to identify the types of body waves propagating in elastic continua as well as to express their velocities and displacements in terms of the properties of these continua. To solve the equations of motion in anisotropic inhomogeneous continua, we use the high-frequency approximation and, hence, establish the concept of a ray.  In Part 3, we show that, in elastic continua, a ray is tantamount to a trajectory along which a seismic signal propagates in accordance with the variational principle of stationary traveltime. Consequently, many seismic problems in elastic continua can be conveniently formulated and solved using the calculus of variations. In Part 4, we describe two mathematical concepts that are used in the book; namely, homogeneity of a function and Legendre's transformation. This section also contains a list of symbols.","price":"$ 143.51"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Cain, William"],"pubdate":"2010-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5107811.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"248","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5107811.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5107811.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5107811.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6032245\/","id":"6032245","publisher":"","isbn10":"1141720930","isbn13":"9781141720934","title":"Theory of Solid and Braced Elastic Arches","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6032245","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 30.23"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Adams, Frank Dawson; Coker, Ernest George;"],"pubdate":"2010-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5207207.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"100","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5207207.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5207207.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5207207.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6211270\/","id":"6211270","publisher":"","isbn10":"1145747701","isbn13":"9781145747708","title":"An Investigation Into the Elastic Constants of Rocks","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6211270","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.

Harris intended to explain in this book the special techniques required to model the radiation and diffraction of elastic and surface waves. Sadly, he died before he could fulfil this ambition, but his plan has been brought to fruition by a team of his distinguished collaborators. The book begins with the basic underlying equations for wave motion and then builds upon this foundation by solving a number of fundamental scattering problems. The remaining chapters provide a thorough introduction to modern techniques that have proven essential to understanding radiation and diffraction at high frequencies. Graduate students, researchers and professionals in applied mathematics, physics and engineering will find that the chapters increase in complexity, beginning with plane-wave propagation and spectral analyses. Other topics include elastic wave theory, the Wiener-Hopf technique, the effects of viscosity on acoustic diffraction, and the phenomenon of channelling of wave energy along guided structures.","price":"$ 111.87"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Webster, Arthur Gordon"],"pubdate":"2010-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5222412.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"616","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5222412.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5222412.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5222412.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6219591\/","id":"6219591","publisher":"","isbn10":"1146339372","isbn13":"9781146339377","title":"The Dynamics of Particles and of Rigid, Elastic, and Fluid Bodies","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6219591","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.

The second volume is dedicated to propagation of linear plane, spherical and cylindrical acoustic waves in different media. Chapter 1 is devoted to principles of geometric acoustic in plane wave approximation. The eikonal and transport equations are derived. Ray tracing and wavefront construction techniques are explained. Chapter 2 deals with dynamic properties of wave fields. The behavior of pressure and displacements amplitudes in zero approximation is analysed in two ways: using Poynting vector and solving the transport equation. This chapter contains several examples related to shadow zones and caustics. In Chapter 3, using the results of analysis of high-frequency wave kinematics and dynamics some fundamental aspects of Kirchhoff migration are described. Chapters 4 and 5 are devoted to propagation of plane waves in media with flat boundaries in the case of normal and oblique incidence. Special attention is paid to the case when an incident angle exceeds the critical angles. Formation of normal modes in the waveguide is discussed. Chapter 6 deals with a spherical wave reflection and refraction. The steepest descent method is introduced to describe the behavior of reflected, transmitted, head and evanescent waves. In Chapter 7, propagation of stationary and transient waves in a waveguide formed by a flat layer with low velocity are investigated. Normal modes and waves related to the branch points of integrands under consideration are studied. Dispersive properties of normal modes are discussed. Chapter 8 describes wave propagation inside cylinder in acoustic media. Several appendices are added to help the reader understand different aspects of mathematics used in the book.","price":"$ 263.29"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Li, Yiwei; Starnes, Jr.; Elishakoff, Isaac"],"pubdate":"2001-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s18968673.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"352","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s18968673.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s18968673.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s18968673.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/12043593\/","id":"12043593","publisher":"","isbn10":"0521782104","isbn13":"9780521782104","title":"Non-Classical Problems in the Theory of Elastic Stability","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/12043593","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"When a structure is put under an increasing compressive load, it becomes unstable and buckling occurs.

It describes the advances which had been made in one field of the design of ship structures, a field also of importance in the design of bridges and other rigid structures on land. A grillage is a structure of intersecting beams, usually attached to one side of a continuous plate panel, which is loaded normal to its surface. The decks, bottoms and bulkheads (vertical divisions) of ships are usually flat grillages, and this form of construction is also commonly used in the decks of bridges. The methods of plastic analysis are not directly applicable to plated grillage structures and Mr Clarkson has therefore discussed only elastic methods of design.","price":"$ 44.06"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Villaggio, Piero"],"pubdate":"2005-9","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s18933288.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"696","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s18933288.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s18933288.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s18933288.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/12025445\/","id":"12025445","publisher":"","isbn10":"052101798X","isbn13":"9780521017985","title":"Mathematical Models for Elastic Structures","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/12025445","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Elastic structures, conceived as slender bodies able to transmit loads, have been studied by scientists and engineers for centuries.

While these processes are often very complex, one way to begin to understand them is to study wave propagation in the linear approximation. This is a book describing such propagation using, as a context, the equations of elasticity. Two unifying themes are used. The first is that an understanding of plane wave interactions is fundamental to understanding more complex wave interactions. The second is that waves are best understood in an asymptotic approximation where they are free of the complications of their excitation and are governed primarily by their propagation environments. The topics covered include reflection, refraction, the propagation of interfacial waves, integral representations, radiation and diffraction, and propagation in closed and open waveguides. Linear Elastic Waves is an advanced level textbook directed at applied mathematicians, seismologists, and engineers.","price":"$ 146.90"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Libai, A.; Simmonds, J.

After laying out the general theory, Koiter applies the theory to a number of applications, with a chapter devoted to each. These include a variety of beam, plate, and shell structural problems and some basic continuum elasticity problems. Koiter's classic results on the nonlinear buckling and imperfection-sensitivity of cylindrical and spherical shells are included. The treatments of both the fundamental aspects and the applications are completely self contained. This book was recorded as a detailed set of notes by Arnold van der Heijden from W. T.

The book is divided into two parts. The first part deals with problems  related to the construction of refined theories (such as those of  Richhof-Love, von Karman-A. Fioppl, and Reissner) and  their equivalent new models (depending on arbitrary control  functions). These are investigated by means of a new variational  principle. Methods of reduction, containing regular processes of study  of spatial problems, are also studied. Topics treated include problems  of solvability, error estimations, convergence of processes in Sobolev  spaces and construction of effective schemes of solutions of  two-dimensional boundary value problems for systems of partial  differential equations. The second part considers stable projective methods, using classical  orthogonal polynomials and a new class of spline-functions as  coordinate systems, and their numerical realizations for a design of  one- and two- dimensional boundary value problems from the first part. These efficient methods increase the possibilities of classical  finite-difference, exponential- fitted, variational-discrete and  alternating-direction methods. Audience: This book will be of interest to researchers and  graduate students whose work involves mechanics, analysis, numerics  and computation, mathematical modelling and industrial mathematics,  calculus of variations, and design engineering.","price":"$ 213.57"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Lowe, R.

Inspired by this apparent contradiction,  Strain Solitons in Solids and How to Construct Them refines  the existing theory, explores how to construct a powerful deformation pulse in a waveguide without plastic flow or fracture, and proposes a direct method of strain soliton generation, detection, and observation.The author focuses on the theory, simulation, generation, and propagation of strain solitary waves in a nonlinearly elastic, straight cylindrical rod under finite deformations. He introduces the general theory of wave propagation in nonlinearly elastic solids and shows, from first principles, how its main ideas can lead to successful experiments. In doing so, he develops a new approach  to solving the corresponding doubly dispersive equation (DDE) with dissipative terms, leading to new explicit and exact  solutions. He also shows that the method is applicable to a variety of nonlinear problems.First discovered in virtual reality, nonlinear waves and solitons in solids are finally moving into the genuine reality of physics, mechanics, and engineering. Strain Solitons in Solids and How to Construct Them shows how to balance the mathematics of the problem with  the application of the results to experiments and ultimately to generating and observing solitons in solids.","price":"$ 178.48"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Ibbetson, William John"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s13612827.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"116","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s13612827.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s13612827.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s13612827.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/12924046\/","id":"12924046","publisher":"","isbn10":"1130312976","isbn13":"9781130312973","title":"An Elementary Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Perfectly Elastic Solids; With a Short Account of Viscous Fluids","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/12924046","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["S.

A.V. Pogorelov (Harkov, Ukraine) was the first to provide in his  monographs the geometric construction of the deformed shell surface in  a post-critical stage and deriving explicityly the asymptotic formulas  for the upper and lower critical loads. The geometric method by Pogorelov is one of the most importanty  analytical methods developed during the last century. Its power  consists in its ability to provide a clear geometric picture of the  post critical form of a deformed shell surface, successfully applied  to a direct variational approach to the nonlinear shell stability  problems. Until now, most of Pogorelov's monographs were written in  Russian, which limited the diffusion of his ideas among the international scientific community. The present book is intended to  assist and encourage the researchers in this field to apply the  geometric method and the related results to everyday engineering  practice. Further developments of the geometric method are carried out in this  book and are directed to stability of thin shells in the case of  elastic anisotropy, elastic anisotropy with linear memory and  elasto-plastic properties of the shell material.

The purpose of this title - which is intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students as well as scientists interested in quantitative seismology - is to use aspects of continuum mechanics, wave theory and ray theory to describe phenomena resulting from the propagation of waves. The book is divided into three parts: Elastic continua, Waves and rays, and Variational formulation of rays. In Part I, continuum mechanics are used to describe the material through which seismic waves propagate, and to formulate a system of equations to study the behaviour of such material. In Part II, these equations are used to identify the types of body waves propagating in elastic continua as well as to express their velocities and displacements in terms of the properties of these continua. To solve the equations of motion in anisotropic inhomogeneous continua, the high-frequency approximation is used and establishes the concept of a ray. In Part III, it is shown that in elastic continua a ray is tantamount to a trajectory along which a seismic signal propagates in accordance with the variational principle of stationary travel time.","price":"$ 205.66"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Kaplunov, J.

We use sound to locate objects, to identify objects, to understand processes going on in nature, to communicate, and to entertain. The elastic properties of materials determine the velocity of sound in them and tell us about their response to stresses something which is very important when we are trying to construct, manufacture, or create something with any material. The \"Handbook of Elastic Properties of Materials\" will provide these characteristics for almost everything whose elastic properties has ever been measured or deduced in a concise and approachable manner. Leading experts will explain the significance of the elastic properties as they relate to intrinsic microscopic behavior, to manufacturing, to construction, or to diagnosis. They will discuss the propagation of sound in newly discovered or created materials, and in common materials which are being investigated with a fresh outlook. The handbook will provide the reader with the elastic properties of the common and mundane, the novel and unique, the immense and the microscopic, and the exorbitantly dense and the ephemeral. You will also find the measurement, and theoretical techniques that have been developed and invented in order to extract these properties from a reluctant nature and recalcitrant systems. Solids, liquids and gases are covered in one handbook. Articles by experts describing insights are developed over long and illustrious careers. It covers properties of esoteric substances, such as normal and dense stars, superfluid helium three, fullerness, two dimensional solids, extraterrestial substances, gems and planetary atmospheres. It also covers properties of common materials such as food, wood used for musical instruments, paper, cement, and cork; and, modern dynamic elastic properties measurement techniques.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Williamson, Benjamin"],"pubdate":"2008-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19079406.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"148","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s19079406.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s19079406.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19079406.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/12201537\/","id":"12201537","publisher":"","isbn10":"0559294301","isbn13":"9780559294303","title":"Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of the Stress and Strain of Elastic Solids","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/12201537","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 23.45"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Williamson, Benjamin"],"pubdate":"2008-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19079389.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"148","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s19079389.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s19079389.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s19079389.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/12201539\/","id":"12201539","publisher":"","isbn10":"0559294328","isbn13":"9780559294327","title":"Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of the Stress and Strain of Elastic Solids","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/12201539","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 28.24"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Maugin, Gerard A."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11559266.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"324","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s11559266.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s11559266.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11559266.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11752412\/","id":"11752412","publisher":"","isbn10":"0198534841","isbn13":"9780198534846","title":"Nonlinear Waves in Elastic Crystals","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/11752412","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Cain, William"],"pubdate":"2012-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s23019026.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"66","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s23019026.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s23019026.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s23019026.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11831678\/","id":"11831678","publisher":"","isbn10":"0217535283","isbn13":"9780217535281","title":"Theory of Solid and Braced Elastic Arches;

propagation in materials of nonlinearly elastic waves of displacements, which corresponds to one modern line of development of the nonlinear theory of elastic waves. The book is divided on five basic parts: the necessary information on waves and materials; the necessary information on nonlinear theory of elasticity and elastic materials; analysis of one-dimensional nonlinear elastic waves of displacement - longitudinal, vertically and horizontally polarized transverse plane nonlinear elastic waves of displacement; analysis of one-dimensional nonlinear elastic waves of displacement - cylindrical and torsional nonlinear elastic waves of displacement; analysis of two-dimensional nonlinear elastic waves of displacement - Rayleigh and Love nonlinear elastic surface waves. The book is addressed first of all to people working in solid mechanics - from the students at an advanced undergraduate and graduate level to the scientists, professionally interesting in waves. But mechanics is understood in the broad sense, when it includes mechanical and other engineering, material science, applied mathematics and physics and so forth. The genesis of this book can be found in author's years of research and teaching while a head of department at SP Timoshenko Institute of Mechanics (National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), a member of Center for Micro and Nanomechanics at Engineering School of University of Aberdeen (Scotland) and a professor at Physical-Mathematical Faculty of National Technical University of Ukraine \"KPI\". The book comprises 11 chapters. Each chapter is complemented by exercises, which can be used for the next development of the theory of nonlinear waves.","price":"$ 202.27"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"244","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/24693360\/","id":"24693360","publisher":"Springer","isbn10":"9401039712","isbn13":"9789401039710","title":"Mechanics of Elastic Biomolecules","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/24693360","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Haus, Emanuele"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26534475.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"128","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26534475.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26534475.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26534475.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/24691981\/","id":"24691981","publisher":"Ledizioni","isbn10":"8867050672","isbn13":"9788867050673","title":"Dynamics of an Elastic Satellite with Internal Friction.

The complexity of elastic wave propagation in anisotropic media has led to a reliance on numerical methods of analysis-methods that are often quite time-consuming and whose  results yield even further difficulties in extracting explicit phenomena and characteristics.Innovative and insightful,  Elastic Waves in Anisotropic Laminates establishes a set of  high-performance, analytical-numerical methods for elastic wave analysis of anisotropic layered structures. The treatment furnishes a comprehensive introduction, sound theoretical  development, and applications to smart materials, plates, and shells. The techniques, detailed in both the time and frequency domains, include methods that combine the finite element method (FEM) with the Fourier transform approach and the  strip element method (SEM). These -methods can also be used for expediently  finding the Green's function for anisotropic laminates useful for inverse problems related to wave propagation, and methods for inverse analyses, including conjugate gradient methods, and genetic algorithms are also introduced.The text is complemented by many examples generated using software codes  based on the techniques developed. Filled with charts and illustrations, Elastic Waves in Anisotropic Laminates is accessible even to readers from non-engineering backgrounds and offers a unique opportunity to discover methods that can lead to an understanding of the dynamic characteristics and wave motion behaviors of advanced composite materials.","price":"USD

degree-of-freedom and multi-degree-of-freedom systems, this book teaches the use of vibration principles in a broad spectrum of applications. In this introduction for undergraduate students, authors Balakumar Balachandran and Edward B. Magrab present vibration principles in a general context and illustrate the use of these principles through carefully chosen examples from different disciplines. Their balanced approach integrates principles of linear and nonlinear vibrations with modeling, analysis, prediction, and measurement so that physical understanding of the vibratory phenomena and their relevance for engineering design can be emphasized. The authors also provide design guidelines that are applicable to a wide range of vibratory systems. MATLAB is thoroughly integrated throughout the text.","price":"$ 281.31"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Johnson, Barbara"],"pubdate":"2007-4","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4866612.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4866612.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4866612.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4866612.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4360167\/","id":"4360167","publisher":"","isbn10":"0800787544","isbn13":"9780800787547","title":"Fresh Elastic for Stretched Out Moms","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4360167","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"A favorite for many years, Fresh Elastic for Stretched-Out Moms is for all moms whose hearts have been broken by their children.

Mechanical deformation of carbon nanotubes is known to cause considerable changes in their physical and chemical properties through the nontrivial structure-property correlation. A strong understanding of their deformation mechanism and available geometry is, therefore, crucial to developing nanotube-based applications. This book concentrates on the remarkable mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, covering theoretical and experimental progresses from the last decade.","price":"$ 169.44"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Miller, Frederic P.;

Phillips argues that Kiesler established a new career trajectory for architects not as master builders, but as research practitioners whose innovative means and methods could advance alternative and speculative architecture. Indeed, Kiesler's own career was the ultimate uncompromising model of a research-based practice.\nExploring Kiesler's formative relationships with the European avant-garde, Phillips shows how Kiesler found inspiration in the plastic arts, experimental theater, early animation, and automatons to develop and refine his spatial concept of the Endless. Moving from Europe to New York in the 1920s, Kiesler applied these radical Dadaist, constructivist, and surrealist practices to his urban display projects, which included shop windows for Saks Fifth Avenue. After launching his innovative Design Correlation Laboratory at Columbia and Yale, Kiesler went on to invent new houses, theaters, and galleries that were meant to move, shift, and adapt to evolutionary changes occurring within the natural and built environment.\nAs Phillips demonstrates vividly, although many of Kiesler's designs remained unbuilt, his ideas proved influential to later generations of architects and speculative artists internationally, including Archigram, Greg Lynn, UNStudio, and Olafur Eliasson.","price":"39.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[""],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/31035123\/","id":"31035123","publisher":"Palala Press","isbn10":"1358506442","isbn13":"9781358506444","title":"【预订】An Investigation Into the Elastic Constants of Rocks: More Especially with Reference to Cubic Compressibility, Issue 46","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/31035123","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"688.84元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[""],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/31065869\/","id":"31065869","publisher":"Palala Press","isbn10":"1358100934","isbn13":"9781358100932","title":"【预订】An Investigation Into the Elastic Constants of Rocks: More Especially with Reference to Cubic Compressibility","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/31065869","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"658.83元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[""],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/31108489\/","id":"31108489","publisher":"","isbn10":"1287955576","isbn13":"9781287955573","title":"【预订】An Investigation Into the Elastic Constants of Rocks: More Especially with Reference to Cubic Compressibility","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/31108489","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"337.97元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31532801.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31532801.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31532801.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31532801.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32642370\/","id":"32642370","publisher":"","isbn10":"3319115316","isbn13":"9783319115313","title":"Partial Stabilization and Control of Distributed Parameter Systems with Elastic Elements","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32642370","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This monograph provides a rigorous treatment of problems related to partial asymptotic stability and controllability for models of flexible structures described by coupled nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations or equations in abstract spaces. The text is self-contained, beginning with some basic results from the theory of continuous semigroups of operators in Banach spaces. The problem of partial asymptotic stability with respect to a continuous functional is then considered for a class of abstract multivalued systems on a metric space. Next, the results of this study are applied to the study of a rotating body with elastic attachments. Professor Zuyev demonstrates that the equilibrium cannot be made strongly asymptotically stable in the general case, motivating consideration of the problem of partial stabilization with respect to the functional that represents “averaged” oscillations. The book’s focus moves on to spillover analysis for infinite-dimensional systems with finite-dimensional controls. It is shown that a family of L2-minimal controls, corresponding to low frequencies, can be used to obtain approximate solutions of the steering problem for the complete system.The book turns from the examination of an abstract class of systems to particular physical examples. Timoshenko beam theory is exploited in studying a mathematical model of a flexible-link manipulator.  Finally, a mechanical system consisting of a rigid body with the Kirchhoff plate is considered. Having established that such a system is not controllable in general, sufficient controllability conditions are proposed for the dynamics on an invariant manifold.Academic researchers and graduate students interested  in control theory and mechanical engineering will find Partial Stabilization and Control of Distributed-Parameter Systems with Elastic Elements a valuable and authoritative resource for investigations on the subject of partial stabilization.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31547598.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31547598.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31547598.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31547598.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32657147\/","id":"32657147","publisher":"","isbn10":"149376375X","isbn13":"9781493763757","title":"Correlation Filters for Elastic-Distorted Live-Scan Fingerprint Recognition","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32657147","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This is a summary of a multi-year study of the use ofdistortion-invariant filters for recognition of live-scan dab fingerprints with elastic distortions.

Either they collapsed in chaos, or society returned to commodity money before that could happen. Drawing upon novel research,Paper Money Collapse conclusively illustrates why paper money systems—those based on an elastic and constantly expanding supply of money as opposed to a system of commodity money of essentially fixed supply—are inherently unstable and why they must lead to economic disintegration. These highly controversial conclusions clash with the present consensus, which holds that elastic state money is superior to inflexible commodity money (such as a gold standard), and that expanding money is harmless or even beneficial for as long as inflation stays low. Contradicting this, Paper Money Collapse shows that:The present crisis is the unavoidable result of continuously expanding fiat moneyThe current policy of accelerated money production to \"stimulate\" the economy is counterproductive and could lead to a complete collapse of the monetary systemWhy many in financial markets, in media, and in the policy establishment are unable (and often unwilling) to fully appreciate the underlying problems with elastic moneyThis compelling new book looks at the breakdown of modern economic theory and the fallacy of mathematical models.

This book extensively describes CHEM self-deployable structures, provides basic property data and characteristics, discusses advantages, and identifies numerous space, commercial, and medical applications. Some of these applications have been experimentally and analytically investigated with inspiring results and are revealed here. CHEM technology has a potential to provide groundbreaking self-deployable space structures. Some cutting-edge space CHEM concepts described in this book represent the introduction of a new generation of space deployable structures. CHEM materials have unique characteristics that enable the manufacture of self-deployable stents and other medical devices not possible currently. One of the medical applications, the CHEM endovascular treatment of aneurysm, is being experimentally explored with promising results that would save lives. This book provides a long list of interesting potential commercial CHEM applications that could simplify and make life easier at low cost. One of these products, the self-reconfiguring armchair, is already being set up for mass production. This book will be of interest to all engineering researchers, scientists, engineers, students, designers, and technologists across their relevant fields of interest. The exceptional characteristics of CHEM technology are presently enabling technologists to develop many applications ranging from outer space to inside the human body.

Formerly a subject of interest only to a few special­ ists and for which the literature was relatively smalI, the needs of structures for aerospace missions instigated a torrent of papers on all facets of the theory which also found application in the less glamorous earthbound shell struc­ tures important in everyday life. Some idea of the rapidity of the development can be gained from the fact that a bibliography* completed in 1953 listed some 1455 books and papers as the sum total ofthe literature on shell theory to that date. Three years later, however, a supplementt added another 884 papers to the list, an increase of 60 per cent in that short period of time. The number of papers published since these listings has increased to an extent that does not bear contemplation. Obviously no single volume could contain all that constitutes the theory of shells and so this book is restricted to that portion of the theory associated with small deformations of elastic shells. Plastic deformations of shells, which is hardly developed, and nonlinear deformations and stability, which would require at least aseparate volume, are thus excluded. Even with this restriction, however, the present volume represents a long overdue compro­ mise between completeness and finiteness. In making this compromise I have undoubtedly omitted discussions of many topics and references to many excellent papers which should have been included.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31736504.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31736504.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31736504.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31736504.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32846195\/","id":"32846195","publisher":"","isbn10":"1333889577","isbn13":"9781333889579","title":"A Perturbation Calculation of the Elastic Scattering of Electrons by Hydrogen Atoms (Classic Reprint)","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32846195","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Excerpt from A Perturbation Calculation of the Elastic Scattering of Electrons by Hydrogen Atoms If the mass of the proton is taken to be infinite, one can, as an alterna -tive, take as the perturbation simply the interaction between the two electrons.

This analysis is difficult for many reasons, including the fact that objects differ in both geometry and topology. In this manuscript, we narrow the problem by focusing on objects with fixed topology, say objects that are diffeomorphic to unit spheres, and develop tools for analyzing their geometries. The main challenges in this problem are to register points across objects and to perform analysis while being invariant to certain shape-preserving transformations. We develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing shapes of spherical objects, i.e., objects that are embeddings of a unit sphere in , including tools for: quantifying shape differences, optimally deforming shapes into each other, summarizing shape samples, extracting principal modes of shape variability, and modeling shape variability associated with populations. An important strength of this framework is that it is elastic: it performs alignment, registration, and comparison in a single unified framework, while being invariant to shape-preserving transformations. The approach is essentially Riemannian in the following sense. We specify natural mathematical representations of surfaces of interest, and impose Riemannian metrics that are invariant to the actions of the shape-preserving transformations. In particular, they are invariant to reparameterizations of surfaces. While these metrics are too complicated to allow broad usage in practical applications, we introduce a novel representation, termed square-root normal fields (SRNFs), that transform a particular invariant elastic metric into the standard L(2) metric. As a result, one can use standard techniques from functional data analysis for registering, comparing, and summarizing shapes. Specifically, this results in: pairwise registration of surfaces; computation of geodesic paths encoding optimal deformations; computation of Karcher means and covariances under the shape metric; tangent Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and extraction of dominant modes of variability; and finally, modeling of shape variability using wrapped normal densities. These ideas are demonstrated using two case studies: the analysis of surfaces denoting human bodies in terms of shape and pose variability; and the clustering and classification of the shapes of subcortical brain structures for use in medical diagnosis. This book develops these ideas without assuming advanced knowledge in differential geometry and statistics. We summarize some basic tools from differential geometry in the appendices, and introduce additional concepts and terminology as needed in the individual chapters.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31733843.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31733843.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31733843.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31733843.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32843537\/","id":"32843537","publisher":"","isbn10":"3805530781","isbn13":"9783805530781","title":"Biology and Pathology of Elastic Tissues","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32843537","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"页面: 232, 精装, S Karger AG","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31634308.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31634308.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31634308.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31634308.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32743940\/","id":"32743940","publisher":"","isbn10":"3659686492","isbn13":"9783659686498","title":"Dynamic Routing and Resource Allocation in Elastic Optical Networks","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32743940","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Elastic Optical Networks (EON) is widely accepted today as the next step in the evolution toward high capacity networking.

Building on the work of Luigi Menabrea, the mathematician Carlo Alberto Castigliano (1847–84) provided the first full proof of these methods in his 1873 dissertation while based in Turin. Equally important was his popularisation of the theory in his Théorie de l'équilibre des systèmes élastiques et ses applications (1879), in which he applied his theory to a wide range of important real-world cases. The work is here reissued in its 1919 English translation, by the consulting engineer and lecturer Ewart S. Andrews. Castigliano covers the basic theory of elastic stresses, introducing useful approximations; he then moves on to the analysis of real structures, including roof trusses, arches and bridges in both iron and masonry.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31784660.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31784660.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31784660.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31784660.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32894370\/","id":"32894370","publisher":"","isbn10":"9811351481","isbn13":"9789811351488","title":"Thermal Elastic  Mechanics Problems of Concrete Rectangular Thin Plate","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32894370","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This book discusses the thermal-elastic mechanics problems of concrete rectangular thin plate.

The mathematical theory of elasticity in mechanics, especially the linearized theory, is quite mature, and is one of the foundations of several engineering sciences. In the last twenty years, there has been significant progress in several areas closely related to this classical field, this applies in particular to the following two areas. First, progress has been made in numerical methods, especially the development of the finite element method. The finite element method, which was independently created and developed in different ways by sci­ entists both in China and in the West, is a kind of systematic and modern numerical method for solving partial differential equations, especially el­ liptic equations. Experience has shown that the finite element method is efficient enough to solve problems in an extremely wide range of applica­ tions of elastic mechanics. In particular, the finite element method is very suitable for highly complicated problems. One of the authors (Feng) of this book had the good fortune to participate in the work of creating and establishing the theoretical basis of the finite element method. He thought in the early sixties that the method could be used to solve computational problems of solid mechanics by computers. Later practice justified and still continues to justify this point of view. The authors believe that it is now time to include the finite element method as an important part of the content of a textbook of modern elastic mechanics.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31500354.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31500354.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31500354.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31500354.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32609884\/","id":"32609884","publisher":"","isbn10":"940108064X","isbn13":"9789401080644","title":"Elastic Analysis of Slab Structures","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32609884","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Any practitioner who takes his profession in earnest, such that daily work is not a heavy duty but part of their life, will recognize in this book the rigorousness of the analysis and the comprehensive presentation of the problems.

Indeed, the computational means that are nowadays available permit the numerical computation of whatever problem; the pro­ gram libraries are extremely rich and programs themselves have developed intensively. Howeyer, though computers are available at any moment without restrictions on the frequency with which they are employed, they finally impoYerish the creative compe­ tency of the civil engineer. Thus, he will calculate increasingly more while devising increasingly less. He will draw less and less on the experience gained in devising and implementing bearing structures because the computational process can be repeated as often as desired over a minimum time-period by means of the available programs. \\Ve note that nowadays structures are no longer investigated or economically designed to comply with the requirements of the topic of interest. :Much to the contrary, the solutions are chosen so as to comply with the capabilities of the programs.

Vitruvius describes a variety of machines for this purpose, the earliest of which were employed merely to raise a portion Of the ﬂuid by which they were impelled. The most simple method of applying this element as a mechanical agent evidently con sisted in the construction of a wheel, the periphery of which was composed of a number of ﬂoat boards. This, on being exposed to the action Of a running stream, was afterwards employed to give motion to a variety of mills, and is at the present time employed in almost every species Of mac chinery. Among the most celebrated hydraulic machines, we may enumerate the Machine Of Marly. This, when first constructed, appears to have produced one-eighth Of the power expended, so that seven eighths Of its power were usually lost.

But what if we all can go farther, push harder, and achieve more than we think we’re capable of?Blending cutting-edge science and gripping storytelling in the spirit of Malcolm Gladwell—who contributes the book’s foreword—award-winning journalist Alex Hutchinson reveals that a wave of paradigm-altering research over the past decade suggests the seemingly physical barriers you encounter as set as much by your brain as by your body. This means the mind is the new frontier of endurance—and that the horizons of performance are much more elastic than we once thought.But, of course, it’s not “all in your head.” For each of the physical limits that Hutchinson explores—pain, muscle, oxygen, heat, thirst, fuel—he carefully disentangles the delicate interplay of mind and body by telling the riveting stories of men and women who’ve pushed their own limits in extraordinary ways.The longtime “Sweat Science” columnist for Outside and Runner’s World, Hutchinson, a former national-team long-distance runner and Cambridge-trained physicist, was one of only two reporters granted access to Nike’s top-secret training project to break the two-hour marathon barrier, an extreme quest he traces throughout the book. But the lessons he draws from shadowing elite athletes and from traveling to high-tech labs around the world are surprisingly universal. Endurance, Hutchinson writes, is “the struggle to continue against a mounting desire to stop”—and we’re always capable of pushing a little farther.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31987486.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31987486.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31987486.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31987486.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/33097490\/","id":"33097490","publisher":"","isbn10":"1402018614","isbn13":"9781402018619","title":"IUTAM Symposium on Multiscale Modeling and Characterization of Elastic-Inelastic Behavior of Engineering Materials: Proceedings of the IUTAM Symposium held in Marrakech, Morocco, 20–25 October 2002","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/33097490","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The papers in this proceeding are a collection of the works presented at the IUTAM symposium-Marrakech 2002 (October 20-25) which brought together scientists from various countries. These papers cover contemporary topics in multiscale modeling and characterization of materials behavior of engineering materials. They were selected to focus on topics related to deformation and failure in metals, alloys, intermetallics and polymers including: experimental techniques, deformation and failure mechanisms, dislocation-based modelling, microscopic-macroscopic averaging schemes, application to forming processes and to phase transformation, localization and failure phenomena, and computational advances. Key areas that are covered by some of the papers include modeling of material deformation at various scales. At the atomistic scale, results from MD simulations pertaining to deformation mechanisms in nano-crystalline materials as well as dislocation-defect interactions are presented. Advances in modeling of deformation in metals using discrete dislocation analyses are also presented, providing an insight into this emerging scientific technique that can be used to model deformation at the microscale. These papers address current engineering problems, including deformation of thin fIlms, dislocation behavior and strength during nanoindentation, strength in metal matrix composites, dislocation-crack interaction, development of textures in polycrystals, and problems involving twining and shape memory behavior.

Smart rotors feature promising load alleviation potential and might provide the technological breakthrough required by the next generation of large wind turbine rotors.The book presents the aero-servo-elastic model of a smart rotor with Adaptive Trailing Edge Flaps for active load alleviation and provides an insight on the rotor aerodynamic, structural and control modeling. A novel model for the unsteady aerodynamics of an air foil section with flap is presented and coupled with a multi-body structural representation. A smart rotor configuration is proposed, where the Adaptive Trailing Edge Flaps extend along the outer 20 % of the blade span. Linear Quadratic and Model Predictive algorithms are formulated to control the flap deflection. The potential of the smart rotor is finally confirmed by simulations in a turbulent wind field. A significant reduction of the fatigue loads on the blades is reported: the flaps, which cover no more than 1.5 % of the blade surface, reduce the fatigue load by 15 %; a combination of flap and individual pitch control allows for fatigue reductions up to 30 %.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31888635.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31888635.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31888635.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31888635.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32998501\/","id":"32998501","publisher":"","isbn10":"9400795254","isbn13":"9789400795259","title":"Vibrations of Elastic Systems: With Applications to MEMS and NEMS","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32998501","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This work presents a unified approach to the vibrations of elastic systems as applied to MEMS devices, mechanical components, and civil structures.

These effects are analyzed as single degree-of-freedom models and as more realistic elastic structures. The governing equations and boundary conditions for beams, plates, and shells with interior and boundary attachments are derived by applying variational calculus to an expression describing the energy of the system. The advantages of this approach regarding the generation of orthogonal functions and the Rayleigh-Ritz method are demonstrated.

The representative examples include void slabs, plates stiffened with beams, stepped thickness plates, cellular plates and floating plates, in addition to normal plates. The closed-form approximate solutions are presented in connection with a groundbreaking methodology that can easily accommodate discontinuous variations in stiffness and mass with continuous function as for a distribution. The closed-form solutions can be used to determine the size of structural members in the preliminary design stages, and to predict potential problems with building slabs intended for human beings’ practical use.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31775898.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31775898.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31775898.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31775898.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/32885604\/","id":"32885604","publisher":"","isbn10":"1358333785","isbn13":"9781358333781","title":"An Inquiry Into the Cause of Natural Death: Or, Death from Old Age; Developing a New and Certain Method of Preventing the Consolidation or Ossification of the Body, and of Thus Indefinitely Prolonging Vigorous, Elastic and Bouyant Health; And of Renderi","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/32885604","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

The setting is purely isothermal and no reference is made to thermodynamics. For the most part attention is restricted to the quasi-static theory, but some brief relevant discussion of time-dependent problems is included.Especially coherent and well written, Professor Ogden's book includes not only all the basic material but many unpublished results and new approaches to existing problems. In part the work can be regarded as a research monograph but, at the same time, parts of it are also suitable as a postgraduate text. Problems designed to further develop the text material are given throughout and some of these contain statements of new results.Widely regarded as a classic in the field, this work is aimed at research workers and students in applied mathematics, mechanical engineering, and continuum mechanics.

This book employs two important analytic techniques to solve the fundamental boundary value problems for the theory of plates with transverse shear deformation, which offers a more complete picture of the physical process of bending than Kirchhoff’s classical one.The first method transfers the ellipticity of the governing system to the boundary, leading to singular integral equations on the contour of the domain. These equations, established on the basis of the properties of suitable layer potentials, are then solved in spaces of smooth (Hölder continuous and Hölder continuously differentiable) functions.The second technique rewrites the differential system in terms of complex variables and fully integrates it, expressing the solution as a combination of complex analytic potentials.The last chapter develops a generalized Fourier series method closely connected with the structure of the system, which can be used to compute approximate solutions. The numerical results generated as an illustration for the interior Dirichlet problem are accompanied by remarks regarding the efficiency and accuracy of the procedure.The presentation of the material is detailed and self-contained, making Mathematical Methods for Elastic Plates accessible to researchers and graduate students with a basic knowledge of advanced calculus.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s32227832.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s32227832.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s32227832.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s32227832.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/33338893\/","id":"33338893","publisher":"","isbn10":"1522852549","isbn13":"9781522852544","title":"The Elastic Behaviour of Dual Moduli Materials in Bending","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/33338893","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Existing literature assumes the equality of elastic modulus under both tension and compression loading for all materials. That this is not universally true is demonstrated in the experimental data of some naturally occurring materials presented in the text.

These are then applied to the experimental results presented in the text to determine the elastic modulus and bending moment of the materials in tension and compression, and to further locate the neutral axis for such dual moduli materials. It is necessary therefore, to take account of the dual moduli phenomenon when using materials that posses this property.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s32243216.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s32243216.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s32243216.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s32243216.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/33354304\/","id":"33354304","publisher":"","isbn10":"331930173X","isbn13":"9783319301730","title":"Elastic Optical Networks: Architectures, Technologies, and Control","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/33354304","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This book presents advances in the field of optical networks - specifically on research and applications in elastic optical networks (EON).

Smart rotors feature promising load alleviation potential and might provide the technological breakthrough required by the next generation of large wind turbine rotors.The book presents the aero-servo-elastic model of a smart rotor with Adaptive Trailing Edge Flaps for active load alleviation and provides an insight on the rotor aerodynamic, structural and control modeling. A novel model for the unsteady aerodynamics of an air foil section with flap is presented and coupled with a multi-body structural representation. A smart rotor configuration is proposed, where the Adaptive Trailing Edge Flaps extend along the outer 20 % of the blade span. Linear Quadratic and Model Predictive algorithms are formulated to control the flap deflection. The potential of the smart rotor is finally confirmed by simulations in a turbulent wind field. A significant reduction of the fatigue loads on the blades is reported: the flaps, which cover no more than 1.5 % of the blade surface, reduce the fatigue load by 15 %; a combination of flap and individual pitch control allows for fatigue reductions up to 30 %.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31965347.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s31965347.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s31965347.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s31965347.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/33075300\/","id":"33075300","publisher":"","isbn10":"1118877322","isbn13":"9781118877326","title":"Paper Money Collapse: The Folly of Elastic Money","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/33075300","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Explore the inevitable collapse of the fiat monetary system Paper Money Collapse: The Folly of Elastic Money, Second Edition challenges the mainstream consensus on money and monetary policy. While it is today generally believed that the transition from 'hard' and inflexible commodity money (such as a gold standard) to entirely flexible and potentially unlimited fiat money under national central banks allows for superior economic stability, Paper Money Collapse shows that the opposite is true. Systems of highly elastic and constantly expanding money are not only unnecessary, even for growing economies, they are always extremely destabilizing. Over time, they must lead to substantial imbalances, including excessive levels of debt and distorted asset prices, that will require ever faster money production to sustain. Ultimately, however, there is no alternative to a complete liquidation of these distortions. Based on insights of many renowned economists and in particular of the Austrian School of Economics, the book explains through rigorous logic and in precise language why our system of flexible fiat money is incompatible with a market economy and therefore unsustainable. Paper money systems have always led to economic disintegration—without exception—throughout history. It will not be different for our system and we may be closer to the endgame than many think. The updated second edition incorporates:  A new introduction and an extended outlook section that discusses various \"endgames\" Responses to criticisms, alternative views, and a critical assessment of 'solutions' Comments on recent policy trends, including attempts to exit the 'easy money' policy mode An evaluation of new crypto-currency Bitcoin  Paper Money Collapse: The Folly of Elastic Money, Second Edition clarifies the problem of paper money clearly and eloquently, and proposes multiple routes to a solution.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s32008825.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s32008825.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s32008825.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s32008825.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/33118873\/","id":"33118873","publisher":"","isbn10":"9682465613","isbn13":"9789682465611","title":"El concreto armado en las estructuras\/ The reinforced concrete in structures: Teoria Elastica.

The theory of elasticity is essential to the recent developments of applied and fundamental science, such as the bio-mechanics of DNA filaments and other macro-molecules, and the animation of virtual characters in computer graphics and materials science. In this book, the emphasis is on the elasticity of thin bodies (plates, shells, rods) in connection with geometry. It covers such topics as the mechanics of hairs (curled and straight), the buckling instabilities of stressed plates, including folds and conical points appearing at larger stresses, the geometric rigidity of elastic shells, and the delamination of thin compressed films. It applies general methods of classical analysis, including advanced nonlinear aspects (bifurcation theory, boundary layer analysis), to derive detailed, fully explicit solutions to specific problems. These theoretical concepts are discussed in connection with experiments. The book is self-contained. Mathematical prerequisites are vector analysis and differential equations. The book can serve as a concrete introduction to nonlinear methods in analysis.","price":"USD 145.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Elastica"],"pubdate":"1995-05","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1660448.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s1660448.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s1660448.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1660448.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1789019\/","id":"1789019","publisher":"Hal Leonard Corporation","isbn10":"0793552818","isbn13":"9780793552818","title":"Elastica","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1789019","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 22.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Vineeth Mohan"],"pubdate":"2015-12-31","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"计算机","title":"计算机"},{"count":1,"name":"elasticsearch","title":"elasticsearch"},{"count":1,"name":"Elasticsearch","title":"Elasticsearch"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28268068.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"183","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28268068.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28268068.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28268068.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26584302\/","id":"26584302","publisher":"Packt Publishing - ebooks Account","isbn10":"1783984929","isbn13":"9781783984923","title":"Elasticsearch Blueprints","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/26584302","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 44.99"}]}

It is written with the practical engineering  reader in mind, dependence on previous knowledge of solid mechanics,  continuum, mechanics or mathematics being minimized. Most of the text  should be readily intelligible to a reader with an undergraduate  background of one or two courses in elementary strength of materials  and a rudimentary knowledge of partial differentiation. Emphasis is  placed on engineering applications of elasticity and examples are  generally worked through to final expressions for the stress and  displacement fields in order to explore the engineering consequences  of the results. The topics covered are chosen with a view to modern research  applications in fracture mechanics, composite materials, tribology and  numerical methods. Thus, significant attention is given to crack and  contact problems, problems involving interfaces between dissimilar  media, thermoelasticity, singular asymptotic stress fields and three-dimensional problems. Problems suitable for class use are included at the end of most of the  chapters. These are expressed wherever possible in the form they would  arise in engineering - i.e. as a body of a given geometry  subjected to prescribed loading - instead of inviting the  student to 'verify' that a given candidate stress function is  appropriate to the problem. The text is therefore written in such a  way as to enable the student to approach such problems deductively. A solutions manual is available directly from the author (e-mail:  jbarber@engin.umich.edu).","price":"USD 243.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bertram, Albrecht"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8412401.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"326","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8412401.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8412401.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8412401.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10261169\/","id":"10261169","publisher":"","isbn10":"3540240330","isbn13":"9783540240334","title":"Elasticity and Plasticity of Large Deformations","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10261169","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The book offers a careful introduction to modern non-linear mechanics.

Melvin Zener，美国理论物理学家Zener（1905–1993），中文译名为甄纳或齐纳，是物理冶金学中非常重要的代表性人物，研究领域涉及磁学、铁磁性、扩散、断裂、内耗、热电性、优化 运算等。他的一生硕果累累，每个概念都有其产生 的背景与历史根源。以他的名字命名的现象有：Zener二极管（齐纳二极管、齐纳击穿）、Zener钉扎、Zener-Hollomon参数等。\nSolid-state physicist Clarence M. Zener, an influential pioneer in the field of materials engineering that blossomed after World War II, brought a deep curiosity and imaginative intuition to a wide range of fundamental scientific phenomena. The results brought not only transformative insights, but also produced innovations in numerous areas of practical application. His contributions included the Zener diode; magnetic oxides formed through Zener double exchange; calculation of diffusion in metals from internal-friction measurements; determination of the fracture strength of metals (as summarized in his seminal book Elasticity and Anelasticity of Metals); engineering optimization with geometric programming; and the identification of potential new technologies such as thermoelectric cooling and the green generation of electrical energy from the oceans. Further, Zener’s insights tended to stimulate experimental inquiry and a new mode of thinking in virtually every field in which he worked. （更多介绍可参照2014年美国科学院Clarence M.

are predicted, from their composition and microstructure, by means of multiscale models. The theoretical developments are supported by comprehensive experiments on cortical bone and on biomaterials made of hydroxyapatite, glass-ceramic, and titanium. Brittle failure of interfaces between isotropic, spherical crystals is investigated as well as an alternative approach using crystal needles for hydroxyapatite biomaterials. A model for cortical bone strength is presented, based on a new vision on bone material failure: mutual ductile sliding of hydroxyapatite mineral crystals along layered water films is followed by rupture of collagen crosslinks. It can satisfactorily predict the strength of different bones from different species, on the basis of their mineral\/collagen content, their porosities, and the mechanical properties of hydroxyapatite and (molecular) collagen.","price":"$ 132.21"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Turner, Claude Allen Porter"],"pubdate":"2012-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11052287.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"106","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s11052287.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s11052287.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11052287.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10898290\/","id":"10898290","publisher":"","isbn10":"1407779370","isbn13":"9781407779379","title":"Elasticity and Strength of Materials Used in Engineering Construction","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10898290","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 25.93"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Barber, J.

It is written with the practical engineering reader in mind, dependence on previous knowledge of Solid Mechanics, Continuum Mechanics or Mathematics being minimized. Most of the text should be readily intelligible to a reader with an undergraduate background of one or two courses in elementary Mechanics of Materials and a rudimentary knowledge of partial differentiation. Emphasis is placed on engineering applications of elasticity and examples are generally worked through to final expressions for the stress and displacement fields in order to explore the engineering consequences of the results. The Topics covered were chosen with a view to modern research applications in Fracture Mechanics, Composite Materials, Tribology and Numerical Methods. Thus, significant attention is given to crack and contact problems, problems involving interfaces between dissimilar media, thermo elasticity, singular asymptotic stress fields and three-dimensional problems. This second edition includes new chapters on antiplane stress systems, Saint-Venant torsion and bending and an expanded section on three-dimensional problems in spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems, including axisymmetric torsion of bars of non-uniform circular cross-section. It also includes over 200 end-of-chapter problems, which are expressed wherever possible in the form they would arise in engineering - i.e. as a body of a given geometry subjected to prescribed loading - instead of inviting the student to 'verify' that a given candidate stress function is appropriate to the problem. Solution of these problems is considerably facilitated by the use of modern symbolic mathematical languages such as MapleA(R) and MathematicaA(R) and electronic files and hints on this method of solution can be accessed at the web site www.elasticity.org.","price":"$ 134.47"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Barber, J.

In particular, the search for compounds with specified desirable properties had produced synthetic materials of great technological importance. This third edition contains authoritative contributions from specialists in the various fields. The aim of the book was to draw together and discuss the problems of physicists, chemists and technologists, and the editors attempted, in so far as it was possible for a science in a state of growth, to trace a unity of thought THAT is seldom apparent in the literature of this subject. The early chapters deal with the physical principles of elasticity, plasticity and viscosity, and relate physical and chemical structure to rheological properties. Individual chapters later in the book contain comparative accounts of a wide range of materials, some naturally occurring and others man-made; the general theoretical laws of rheology are compared with experimental observations.","price":"$ 66.67"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Books, Hephaestus"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10760627.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"52","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s10760627.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s10760627.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10760627.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11113071\/","id":"11113071","publisher":"","isbn10":"1243368519","isbn13":"9781243368515","title":"Elasticity","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/11113071","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Hephaestus Books represents a new publishing paradigm, allowing disparate content sources to be curated into cohesive, relevant, and informative books.

Differential and integral operators on vector and tensor fields of displacements, strains and stresses are considered on a consistent and rigorous basis with respect to curvilinear orthogonal coordinate systems. As a consequence, vector and tensor objects can be manipulated readily, and fundamental concepts can be illustrated and problems solved with ease. The method is illustrated using a variety of plane and three-dimensional elastic problems. General theorems, fundamental solutions, displacements and stress potentials are presented and discussed. The Rayleigh-Ritz method for obtaining approximate solutions is introduced for elastostatic and spectral analysis problems. Containing more than 60 exercises and solutions in the form of Mathematica notebooks that accompany every chapter, the reader can learn and master the techniques while applying them to a large range of practical and fundamental problems.","price":"$ 90.40"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"0","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/18851846\/","id":"18851846","publisher":"BOOK ON DEMAND POD","isbn10":"5877889214","isbn13":"9785877889217","title":"ELASTICAL RESEARCHES","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/18851846","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Surhone, Lambert M.;

It is written with the practical engineering  reader in mind, dependence on previous knowledge of solid mechanics,  continuum, mechanics or mathematics being minimized. Most of the text  should be readily intelligible to a reader with an undergraduate  background of one or two courses in elementary strength of materials  and a rudimentary knowledge of partial differentiation. Emphasis is  placed on engineering applications of elasticity and examples are  generally worked through to final expressions for the stress and  displacement fields in order to explore the engineering consequences  of the results. The topics covered are chosen with a view to modern research  applications in fracture mechanics, composite materials, tribology and  numerical methods. Thus, significant attention is given to crack and  contact problems, problems involving interfaces between dissimilar  media, thermoelasticity, singular asymptotic stress fields and three-dimensional problems. Problems suitable for class use are included at the end of most of the  chapters. These are expressed wherever possible in the form they would  arise in engineering - i.e. as a body of a given geometry  subjected to prescribed loading - instead of inviting the  student to 'verify' that a given candidate stress function is  appropriate to the problem. The text is therefore written in such a  way as to enable the student to approach such problems deductively. A solutions manual is available directly from the author (e-mail:  jbarber@engin.umich.edu).","price":"$

confronts the current crisis of churches. In critical and creative conversation with the German theologian Ernst Troeltsch (1865-1923), Ulrich Schmiedel argues that churches need to be “elasticized” in order to engage the “other.” Examining contested concepts of religiosity, community, and identity, Schmiedel explores how the closure of church against the sociological “other” corresponds to the closure of church against the theological “other.” Taking trust as a central category, he advocates for a turn in the interpretation of Christianity―from “propositional possession” to “performative project,” so that the identity of Christianity is “done” rather than “described.” Through explorations of classical and contemporary scholarship in philosophy, sociology, and theology, Schmiedel retrieves Troeltsch’s interdisciplinary thinking for use in relation to the controversies that encircle the construction of community today. The study opens up innovative and instructive approaches to the investigation of the practices of Christianity, past and present. Eventually, church emerges as a “work in movement,” continually constituted through encounters with the sociological and the theological “other.”","price":"EUR 96"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sadd, Martin H."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"608","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/20520327\/","id":"20520327","publisher":"","isbn10":"0124081363","isbn13":"9780124081369","title":"Elasticity","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/20520327","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Haojiang Ding","Weiqiu Chen","Ling Zhang"],"pubdate":"2010-11-19","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s23126482.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"456","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s23126482.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s23126482.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s23126482.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4785858\/","id":"4785858","publisher":"Springer","isbn10":"9048170184","isbn13":"9789048170180","title":"Elasticity of Transversely Isotropic Materials","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4785858","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 199.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bertram, Albrecht"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21582182.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"358","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s21582182.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s21582182.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21582182.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4696839\/","id":"4696839","publisher":"","isbn10":"3540693998","isbn13":"9783540693994","title":"Elasticity and Plasticity of Large Deformations","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4696839","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"695.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Constantinescu, Andrei\/ Korsunsky, Alexander"],"pubdate":"2007-9","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9087739.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"266","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s9087739.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s9087739.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9087739.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4657880\/","id":"4657880","publisher":"","isbn10":"0521842018","isbn13":"9780521842013","title":"Elasticity with Mathematica","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4657880","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This book, first published in 2007, introduces key ideas and principles in the theory of elasticity with the help of symbolic computation. Differential and integral operators on vector and tensor fields of displacements, strains and stresses are considered on a consistent and rigorous basis with respect to curvilinear orthogonal coordinate systems. As a consequence, vector and tensor objects can be manipulated readily, and fundamental concepts can be illustrated and problems solved with ease. The method is illustrated using a variety of plane and three-dimensional elastic problems. General theorems, fundamental solutions, displacements and stress potentials are presented and discussed. The Rayleigh-Ritz method for obtaining approximate solutions is introduced for elastostatic and spectral analysis problems. Containing more than 60 exercises and solutions in the form of Mathematica notebooks that accompany every chapter, the reader can learn and master the techniques while applying them to a large range of practical and fundamental problems.","price":"$ 164.98"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Romigh, Tiffany"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s25924152.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"260","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s25924152.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s25924152.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s25924152.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/22170097\/","id":"22170097","publisher":"","isbn10":"1936372614","isbn13":"9781936372614","title":"Elasticity","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/22170097","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Barber, J.

Some development experience is expected.\nWhat You Will Learn\nInstall and configure Elasticsearch, Logstash, and KibanaWrite CRUDE operations and other search functionalities using the Elasticsearch Python and Java ClientsBuild analytics using aggregationsSet up and scale Elasticsearch clusters using best practicesMaster document relationships and geospatial dataBuild your own data pipeline using Elastic StackChoose the appropriate amount of shards and replicas for your deploymentBecome familiar with the Elasticsearch APIs\nIn Detail\nElasticsearch is a modern, fast, distributed, scalable, fault tolerant, open source search and analytics engine. It provides a new level of control over how you can index and search even huge sets of data. This course will take you from the basics of Elasticsearch to using Elasticsearch in the Elastic Stack and in production.\nYou'll start with the very basics: Elasticsearch terminology, installation, and configuring Elasticsearch. After this, you'll take a look at analytics and indexing, search, and querying. You'll learn how to create maps and visualizations. You'll also be briefed on cluster scaling, search and bulk operations, backups, and security.\nThen you'll be ready to get into Elasticsearch's internal functionalities including caches, Apache Lucene library, and its monitoring capabilities. You'll learn about the practical usage of Elasticsearch configuration parameters and how to use the monitoring API. You'll discover how to improve the user search experience, index distribution, segment statistics, merging, and more.\nOnce you have mastered this, you'll dive into end-to-end visualize-analyze-log techniques with Elastic Stack (also known as the ELK stack). You'll explore Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana and see how to make them work together to build fresh insights and business metrics out of data. You'll be able to use Elasticsearch with other de facto components in order to get the most out of Elasticsearch.

These problems are formulated over either a half or the whole of a linearly elastic and isotropic two- or three-dimensional space, subject to loads concentrated at points or lines. The discussion of each problem begins with a careful examination of the prevailing symmetries, and proceeds with inverting the canonical order, in that it moves from a search for balanced stress fields to the associated strain and displacement fields.The book, although slim, is  fairly well self-contained; the only prerequisite is a reasonable familiarity with linear algebra (in particular, manipulation of vectors and tensors) and with the usual differential operators of mathematical physics (gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian); the few nonstandard notions are introduced with care.
