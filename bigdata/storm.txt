Words can inspire us, provoke us to rage, bring us close to one another, make us happy, and make us sad. It takes us from one emotion to the next covering every spectrum of the human existence and experience. It is an expression of art and emotion through spoken and written words. It is the stories from the mouths of griots that traveled the middle passage carrying our history in their belly. It is the song of the field slave that began as a prayer in a whisper of freedom, and ended as a tribute to the past in the mouths of children during black history month. It is the hook of your favorite song that started as a line in the mind of an artist that he could not shake. It is the flawless movements of a dancer that started as the awkward pirouettes of a little girl in her ballet class mirror. It is the first dance of a bride and groom that started as a mutual glance of two strangers across a crowded room. It is the birth of a child that started as hope in the hearts of her parents.

澳大利亚悉尼。因自幼患有哮喘，多幽居独处。怀特在澳大利亚的农场度过了童年时光，1932年进入剑桥大学国王学院攻读法国与德国文学，读书期间出版了他的首部诗集《农夫与其他诗》。\n怀特一生创作颇丰，出版有《人树》（1955）、《探险家沃斯》（1957）、《乘战车的人们》（1961）、《风暴眼》（1973）、《树叶裙》（1976）等长篇小说12部，中短篇小说集3部，此外还有剧作8部，以及诗歌、自传及未出版作品多种。怀特的作品笔触细腻、极富诗意，擅长在意识流及叙事之间自由切换，有着极高的艺术水准。怀特一生拒绝了无数文学奖项，也很少接受媒体采访。1990年因病去世于悉尼的公寓。\n译者简介\n朱炯强（1933—

simple rhymed text and bright, bold art as they take their first steps toward reading independently.\n\nWhen a twister hits the pond near Farmer Brown’s farm, some very odd things happen. The fish and frogs take flight. They land in some unlikely places—like the barn and the pigs’ trough—setting off an uproarious chain of events that affects the entire farm. Once the weather subsides and the farmer and his family emerge from the storm cellar, they encounter a whole new world, including some unexpected (and four-legged) tenants in their house!\n\nStep into Reading is a complete literacy program with something for every child.

R. Martin's epic high fantasy series. In A Game of Thrones, an ancient kingdom was torn by the ambitions of ruthless men and women; in A Clash of Kings, war, sorcery, and madness swept over the kingdom like a voracious beast of prey. Now, as the brutal struggle for power nears its tumultuous climax, the battered and divided kingdom faces its most terrifying invasion--one that is being spearheaded from beyond the grave....\nA Storm Of Swords\nOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. Filled with the stench of death and decay from the destructive dynastic war, Daenerys is gathering allies and strength for an assault on King's Landing, hoping to win back the crown she believes is rightfully hers. But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings bent on overwhelming the Seven Kingdoms arrives from the outermost lineof civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. And as the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest in the quest for victory until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords....Brilliantly conceived and grand in scope, A Storm of Swords is the incredible tale of a world of harsh beauty and powerful magic, torn by treachery, ravaged by brutality, and consumed by greed and ambition. It portrays a war-torn landscape in which nobles and commoners, heroes and villains, the freeborn and the enslaved, all struggle to survive and to find their destinies...along with the dazzling bounty and wondrous enchantment that was once their birthright in the Seven Kingdoms.","series":{"id":"13201","title":"A Song of Ice and Fire"},"price":"GBP

我们寄居在病毒的星球\n如果有一位聪明的天外来客要以哪些生物构成地球生物多样性和生物量的主体为基础，编撰一部生物百科全书的话，其中大部分内容将会介绍肉眼看不见的世界和原核生物。被我们一般认为是全部生物的真核生物，只用薄薄几卷就可以被介绍完。而人类，不过是动物卷里一个显眼的注脚而已。\n02  狩猎，加速病毒的跨种群传播\n我们倾向于将性或生育之类的事视为亲密举动，因为这些行为将个体以正常互动无法企及的方式联系在一起，但从微生物的视角来看，狩猎和屠宰代表着终极亲密行为。这是将一个物种和另一个物种身上的所有组织，连同栖息在每一个物种上的特定微生物都连接起来的行为。\n03  微生物净化使人类更脆弱\n当人类祖先从雨林踏入草原，人口的锐减、栖息地的变化以及蒸煮食物等生活方式的新变化，使得他们的微生物库的规模不断缩减，一些抵御传染性疾病的基因防御能力也随之降低。当人类遭到猿类表亲的微生物库侵害时，鲜有招架之功。这为病毒风暴的酝酿创造了条件。\n04  驯养活动对病毒传播的三重影响\n从抓捕动物到驯养家畜，从采集果实到种植植物，人类祖先的生活开始由游牧转型为定居。而人类与家畜的亲密接触、家畜与野生动物“剪不断、理还乱”的联系、彼此连接的大规模固定社区的发展壮大，让人类置身于一个将首次暴发流行病的世界。\n第二部分  流行病风暴来袭\n05  什么是流行病\n全球交通枢纽将人和动物联系在一起，催生出了一个容易被流行病侵害的互联世界。而我们是否将一种传播的微生物定义为流行病，与其致命性无关。流行病只是病毒传播能力的标记。所有大陆上都有个体被感染到的一种新感染原，我们称之为流行病。\n06  地球村与流行病时代\n公路、铁路、航海和航空等交通方式的变革，创造了一个全新的互联世界。这给人类带来了便利，却也让以前分散在各处并处于静止状态的病毒有机会快速流动，高度混合。这一事实将永久改变流行病影响人类的方式，把我们真正带入流行病时代。\n07  医学技术让我们更“亲密”\n输血、移植和注射等医学技术的革新，帮我们摆脱了很多致命疾病的威胁，也使我们的血液、器官与其他人、甚至其他物种的身体组织之间，产生了地球上有生命以来史无前例的联结。人类成为彼此关系亲密的物种，为流行病传播提供了新路径。\n08  新一波流行病威胁\n当我们将经济开发的足迹伸向丛林，我们也把新的病毒带回城市，高密度的城市人口、野生动物的活体交易、免疫力低下的易感人群，为病毒间的基因重组提供了温床。从未谋面的微生物相遇后将生成新的镶嵌体感染原，其传播方式是母代病毒无法办到的。新的流行病，已经来袭。\n第三部分  流行病监测与防控\n09  全球性监测系统的建立\n等到流行病大暴发后再去应对，往往为时已晚。如何在致命性病毒演变成流行病之前就抓住它、遏制它 ?我们在世界上最偏僻的地方设立监测点，把与动物密切接触的猎人当作哨兵人群。当感染源从动物跳到人类身上时，流行病的警报就拉响了。\n10  大数据时代的流行病预测\n科学新技术的发展，让我们识别病毒的能力得到加强；而手机信息、搜索引擎、社交媒体等现代信息和传播技术手段的综合运用更是绘制了一副包含了层层信息的疫情聚合图，为我们提早捕获流行病暴发信息提供了条件。谁将是最终的赢家？是流行病将横扫人类，毁掉数百万生命，还是科技将策马前去，拯救人类？\n11  病毒对疾病治疗的积极作用\n病毒并不总是有害的，如果利用得当，它们能帮我们预防传染性疾病，控制慢性病发展，甚至直接治疗一些疾病。公共卫生事业的目的，不应该是打造一个完全无菌的世界，而是找到坏家伙并控制它们。有朝一日，我们保护自身的方式，也许是仰仗与我们共生的病毒，而不是消灭它们。\n12  流行病的末日来临\n流行病环球免疫系统的建立，需要政府、企业、公民的共同努力。我们处在一个用技术手段建造环球免疫系统的时代，应该、也能够将流行病预测和预防做得更好。当我们能够宣布“这是最后的一种流行病”时，我们发现和遏制流行病的能力，已经强到连流行病这个词都不需要了。\n致谢\n译者后记","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/31734110\/","pages":"234","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s27251148.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s27251148.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27251148.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/25857941\/","id":"25857941","publisher":"浙江人民出版社","isbn10":"7213056611","isbn13":"9787213056611","title":"病毒来袭","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/25857941","alt_title":"The

THE GATHERING STORM depicts the rise of Hitler and the indifference of the leaders of the European democracies to the clouds of the gathering storm.

hospital ravaged by Hurricane Katrina – and her suspenseful portrayal of the quest for truth and justice \n  \nIn the tradition of the best writing on medicine, physician and reporter Sheri Fink reconstructs five days at Memorial Medical Center and draws the reader into the lives of those who struggled mightily to survive and to maintain life amidst chaos.\n \n  After Katrina struck and the floodwaters rose, the power failed, and the heat climbed, exhausted caregivers chose to designate certain patients last for rescue. Months later, several health professionals faced criminal allegations that they deliberately injected numerous patients with drugs to hasten their deaths. \n\n Five Days at Memorial , the culmination of six years of reporting, unspools the mystery of what happened in those days, bringing the reader into a hospital fighting for its life and into a conversation about the most terrifying form of health care rationing.\n\nIn a voice at once involving and fair, masterful and intimate, Fink exposes the hidden dilemmas of end-of-life care and reveals just how ill-prepared we are in America for the impact of large-scale disasters—and how we can do better. A remarkable book, engrossing from start to finish,  Five Days at Memorial  radically transforms your understanding of human nature in crisis.","price":"GBP

A storm-tossed crossing on the North Sea; a catastrophic ferry accident; hundreds dead. Detective Chief Inspector Kate Beauchamp is one of the survivors but her ferocious fight to stay alive brings with it a high cost: a burden of guilt that she should live while some of her friends died; a terror of water; a frozen inner core that never seems to melt. When the body of a young female journalist is found in Aberdeen soon after the disaster, Kate insists on conducting the investigation -- partly to exorcize her own demons, partly because she feels a strange affinity with the victim. The killing is peculiarly brutal and the murderer has left a unique calling card: attached to the woman's neck is a poisonous snake. Into this emotional cauldron steps the last man on earth Kate wants to see -- her estranged father, Frank, in Aberdeen to conduct the marine inquiry into the sinking. Was the disaster the result of a bomb, as claimed by the ferry-line's chairman, or is he trying to hide something? In a sweltering heatwave, Kate and Frank conduct their highly pressured investigations. But for both of them, danger is approaching fast -- a vortex of violence which will sweep them up and endanger their very lives.","price":"124.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Hickman, Wilson"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8326523.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"144","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8326523.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8326523.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8326523.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10115244\/","id":"10115244","publisher":"","isbn10":"1438994125","isbn13":"9781438994123","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10115244","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Dennis Wilson Jason's normal life is thrown out the window when he gets into a bit of a mishap involving a thunderstorm and a machine at a science demonstration.

MacHale is the author of the bestselling book series Pendragon - Journal of an Adventure Through Time and Space; the spooky Morpheus Road trilogy and the whimsical picture book The Monster Princess. The first book of his new adventure trilogy, SYLO, was published in July of 2013. In addition to his published works, he has written, directed and produced numerous award-winning television series and movies for young people including Are You Afraid of the Dark?; Flight 29 Down and Tower of Terror. D.J. lives with his family in Southern California.","summary":"From D.J. MacHale—the #1 New York Times bestselling author and co-creator of the popular Nickelodeon series Are You Afraid of the Dark?—comes STORM, the exhilarating, action-packed sequel to SYLO:\nAfter a harrowing escape from Pemberwick Island, Tucker Pierce and his surviving friends—Tori, Kent, and Olivia—have finally reached the mainland, only to find that no one is left.\nThat’s not their only sickening discovery. Moments before they are attacked by another of the mysterious black planes, they investigate one’s wreck and are horrified to find that it bears the logo of the U.S. Air Force. This can only mean one thing: the United States is at war with itself—the deadly technology of the Air Force against the brute force of the Navy’s SYLO unit, which still holds Pemberwick Island and its residents captive.\nTucker must lead his friends to safety, but his head is spinning. How can the Air Force be perpetuating such genocide against not only its own citizens, but the world? What is SYLO’s role in this, and why did Tucker’s parents betray him by allying with SYLO, whose commander, Captain Granger, killed Tori’s father at point-blank range? And what did his mother mean when she told him to trust no one?\nTucker, Tori, and friends set off cross-country on a quest for answers and, for Tucker, vengeance. But as one highway gives way to the next—and one death-defying escape precedes another—Tucker soon realizes that “trust no one” doesn’t just mean the U.S. military.","series":{"id":"31828","title":"The SYLO Chronicles"},"price":"USD 17.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Hess, Norah"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/24649622\/","id":"24649622","publisher":"","isbn10":"1477806849","isbn13":"9781477806845","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/24649622","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Angler, Evan"],"pubdate":"2013-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24546015.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s24546015.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s24546015.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24546015.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/20488820\/","id":"20488820","publisher":"","isbn10":"1400321972","isbn13":"9781400321971","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/20488820","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 11.29"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Nature and Culture","author":["John Withington"],"pubdate":"2016-9-19","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28704264.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"224","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28704264.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28704264.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28704264.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26789340\/","id":"26789340","publisher":"Reaktion Books","isbn10":"1780236611","isbn13":"9781780236612","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/26789340","alt_title":"","author_intro":"John Withington is an award-winning television journalist and one of Britain's leading disaster historians.

Devastating, diverse, and sometimes appearing completely out of nowhere, storms are also a source of both scientific and aesthetic wonder. In Storm: Nature and Culture, John Withington takes an in-depth and unique look at the nature of storms and the impact that they have – both physical and cultural – on our lives.\nWithington shows how storms have changed the course of human history. From Roman times to the modern day, he shows how their devastating effects have wiped out entire communities, changed the fates of battle, and even reset the entire planet. He also shows how beneficial they have been to us: as an important feature of our atmosphere and climate, but also as a source of inspiration for nearly every artist who has ever lived, from Homer to Rembrandt, in works from the Old Testament to Robinson Crusoe. Beautifully illustrated, Storm: Nature and Culture offers a fascinating look at Earth's most fearsome events.","price":"GBP 17.11"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Reg Grant"],"pubdate":"2006-08","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4330458.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"402","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4330458.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4330458.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4330458.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4805422\/","id":"4805422","publisher":"Wipf & Stock Publishers","isbn10":"1597528544","isbn13":"9781597528542","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4805422","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 32.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Pritekel, Kim"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5615530.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"236","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5615530.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5615530.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5615530.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4855756\/","id":"4855756","publisher":"","isbn10":"1933720433","isbn13":"9781933720432","title":"Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4855756","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In Medieval Europe, the name of the game is survival - the stakes are raised when the Black Plague hits in 1349.

sixteen-year-old stowaway discovers her destiny on Noah’s ark in this riveting reimagining from award-winning author Donna Jo Napoli, available in time for the March 2014 major motion picture Noah.The rain starts suddenly, hard and fast. After days of downpour, her family lost, Sebah takes shelter in a tree, eating pine cones and the raw meat of animals that float by. With each passing day, her companion, a boy named Aban, grows weaker. When their tree is struck by lightning, Sebah is tempted just to die in the flames rather than succumb to a slow, watery death. Instead, she and Aban build a raft. What they find on the stormy seas is beyond imagining: a gigantic ark. But Sebah does not know what she’ll find on board, and Aban is too weak to leave their raft. Themes of family, loss, and ultimately, survival and love make for a timeless story. Donna Jo Napoli has imagined a new protagonist to tell the story of Noah and his ark. As rain batters the earth, Noah, his family, and hordes of animals wait out the storm, ready to carry out their duty of repopulating the earth.

Apache Storm, an efficient distributed stream processing platform, does for real-time computation what Hadoop did for batch analysis. Its efficient stream processing capabilities are relied upon by giants like Twitter and Yahoo for swiftly extracting intelligence from their Big Data streams. Fault tolerant guarantees of Storm make it an invaluable and highly versatile platform in the Big Data landscape. It integrates seamlessly with battle-tested message queuing systems (like Kafka) and NoSQL databases (like Cassandra). Storm is built to run on the JVM but provides straightforward extensions for working with non-JVM languages like Ruby and Python.\nStorm Applied is a practical guide to using Apache Storm for the real-world tasks associated with processing and analyzing real-time data streams. This immediately-useful book starts by building a solid foundation of the Storm essentials so that you learn how to think about designing Storm solutions the right way from day one. But it quickly dives into real-world case studies that will bring the novice up to speed with productionizing Storm: the knowledge needed to scale a high throughput stream processor and ensure smooth operation within a production cluster. With that mastery of Storm in hand, it moves on to teach you how to use Trident to treat streams as batches for solving a different class of problems. Finally, it will cover all the different and interesting tools available within the Storm open source community that are crucial for any seasoned Storm developer.","price":"USD 49.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Patterns for Distributed Real-time Computation","author":["P.

The authors, however, bring this story alive in a fast-moving book, and the reader sees how events of that time are very relevant for today's financial world. In spite of all of our advances, including a stronger monetary system and modern tools for managing risk, Bruner and Carr help us understand that we are not immune to a future crisis.\"\n    —Dwight B. Crane, Baker Foundation Professor, Harvard Business School         \"Bruner and Carr provide a thorough, masterly, and highly readable account of the 1907 crisis and its management by the great private banker J. P. Morgan. Congress heeded the lessons of 1907, launching the Federal Reserve System in 1913 to prevent banking panics and foster financial stability. We still have financial problems. But because of 1907 and Morgan, a century later we have a respected central bank as well as greater confidence in our money and our banks than our great-grandparents had in theirs.\"\n    —Richard Sylla, Henry Kaufman Professor of the History of Financial Institutions and Markets, and Professor of Economics, Stern School of Business, New York University         \"A fascinating portrayal of the events and personalities of the crisis and panic of 1907. Lessons learned and parallels to the present have great relevance. Crises and panics are as much a part of our future as our past.\"\n    —John Strangfeld, Vice Chairman, Prudential Financial         \"Who would have thought that a hundred years after the Panic of 1907 so much remained to be written about it? Bruner and Carr break significant new ground because they are willing to do the heavy lifting of combing through massive archival material to identify and weave together important facts. Their book will be of interest not only to banking theorists and financial historians, but also to business school and economics students, for its rare ability to teach so clearly why and how a panic unfolds.\"\n    —Charles Calomiris, Henry Kaufman Professor of Financial Institutions, Columbia University, Graduate School of Business","price":"USD

Teenage stowaway Jack Sparrow has assembled a motley crew, and theyre on the quest of a lifetime. Their goal: to locate and procure the legendary Sword of Corts, which will grant them unimaginable power. But will this ragtag team of adventurers survive their first mission, or will they succumb to the power of the sea, vicious pirates, and ancient curses? \n\n About  Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow  \nPirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow is a series for young readers of nine to twelve years written by Rob Kidd. The series are prequels to the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The series details Jack Sparrow's teen years prior to the events of the movies.\n\n About  Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow　The coming storm　  \nRelease Date: June 1, 2006 (USA) In the beginning Jack is in a Tortuga tavern, looking for his satchel, which has been stolen. He thinks he has found it under the seat of a notorious pirate Torrents, who catches Jack stealing. In the ensuing bar fight, Jack slips out, only to find out that the satchel isn't his. This one contains, among various personal items, the magical sheath for the Sword of Cortés. The bar attendant, Arabella, who pulled Jack out of the fight, makes this discovery with him. They plan together to a ship to go look for the storied Sword of Cortés, and reunite it with its sheath. Arabella directs Jack to an abandoned ship, the Barnacle. Before they leave Tortuga, a young boy, Fitzwilliam P. Dalton III, insists on joining them for their quest. The three sail for many days and come upon an island, where they meet two thirteen year old boys, Jean and Tumen, and their cat sister Constance. Jack remarks about The Sword of Cortés, and Jean and Tumen lead the crew to a 'dead' city on the cursed island. Inside the main building of the city, the crew find the skeleton of the city's king, Stone-Eyed Sam, who is said to be holding the Sword, but it is missing. Jack pockets the fabled stone eye of the now-dead former pirate king as a souvenir. The crew find left footprints on the ground, and soon realize that the notorious pirate, Left Foot Louis, has it. They all go rushing to the Barnacle, when they suddenly come face to face with Torrents, a crew member of the feared Davy Jones's crew. They all battle on the beach, for who would get the Sword of Cortés's sheath, and Jack eventually defeats Torrents (look out for a reference to Ben Franklin!) and escape on the Barnacle.\n\nIt is revealed in this book that Jack knew Benjamin Franklin, and taught him the secrets of electricity.\n\n Book Dimension   \nlength: (cm)18.9 　 width:(cm)14.5","price":"USD 4.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":4,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"and the Big Storm","author":["Norman Bridwell"],"pubdate":"1995-4","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"英文绘本","title":"英文绘本"},{"count":1,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":1,"name":"绘本","title":"绘本"},{"count":1,"name":"童书","title":"童书"},{"count":1,"name":"Clifford系列","title":"Clifford系列"},{"count":1,"name":"0－3岁第三阶段","title":"0－3岁第三阶段"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8506008.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8506008.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8506008.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8506008.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2094528\/","id":"2094528","publisher":"0-590","isbn10":"0590257552","isbn13":"9780590257558","title":"Clifford AND THE BIG STORM","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2094528","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"在线阅读本书\n\n  When a hurricane strikes while Clifford and Emily Elizabeth are having fun visiting her grandmother at the beach, Clifford the big red dog knows just what to do to keep everyone safe.","price":"30.0"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Feast for Crows, a Storm of Swords: Steel and Snow: Part 1 of, a Clash of Kings, a Game of Thrones, a ... 2: Blood and Gold & a Dance with Dragons","author":["George R.

Having taken the reader from the foundation of the GDR, through the peaceful revolution, to the unification of Germany, the story ends with some reflections on the church's past as well as on the challenges it faces in present-day Europe. \"Protestants in Communist East Germany\" makes a unique contribution to existing literature by drawing not only on written sources but on a series of first-hand interviews with theologians, pastors and lay people of different ages whose experiences, views and analyses bring the story to life. The East German church's relationship to the state will probably always remain controversial and the vision for a different socialism in the GDR espoused by those involved in the peaceful revolution may now be considered illusionary. Nevertheless, many of the issues raised by the Protestants in the GDR remain as vital challenges to the churches in Europe today.\nShow More\nShow Less","price":"USD 119.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"'August Storm'","author":["David Glantz"],"pubdate":"2003-2-27","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"军事史","title":"军事史"},{"count":2,"name":"战争史","title":"战争史"},{"count":1,"name":"苏联","title":"苏联"},{"count":1,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":1,"name":"二战","title":"二战"},{"count":1,"name":"Glantz","title":"Glantz"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s14333588.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"368","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s14333588.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s14333588.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s14333588.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/12294480\/","id":"12294480","publisher":"Routledge","isbn10":"0714653004","isbn13":"9780714653006","title":"Soviet Operational and Tactical Combat in Manchuria, 1945","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/12294480","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"On 9 August 1945 a force of over 1.5 million Red Army soldiers employed extensive and imaginative maneuver to overcome terrain thought to be inpenetrable.

To accomplish this unprecedented feat, the Soviet High Command had to transfer more than 500,000 troops, 7000 guns and mortars, 2000 tanks, 17,000 trucks, and thousands of tons of military equipment and supplies up to 6000 miles from European Russia to the Far East in one of the most massive and rapid military regroupings in history. Volume II covers the detailed course of operational and tactical fighting in virtually every combat sector.","price":"USD 168.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":6,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"like a storm","author":["雨木シュウスケ","深遊"],"pubdate":"2014-4-8","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"轻小说","title":"轻小说"},{"count":2,"name":"雨木シュウスケ","title":"雨木シュウスケ"},{"count":1,"name":"钢壳都市","title":"钢壳都市"}],"origin_title":"鋼殻のレギオス23 ライク・ア・ストーム","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27247683.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":["梁恩嘉"],"catalog":"","pages":"244","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s27247683.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s27247683.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27247683.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/25832263\/","id":"25832263","publisher":"台灣角川","isbn10":"986325889X","isbn13":"9789863258896","title":"鋼殼都市雷吉歐斯 23","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/25832263","alt_title":"鋼殻のレギオス23 ライク・ア・ストーム","author_intro":"作者：雨木シュウケス\n以第十五屆奇幻長篇小說大賞佳作《マテリアルナイト 少女は巨人と踊る》一書出道。\n插畫：深遊\n插畫家。除了小說插畫之外也負責執筆《鋼殼都市雷吉歐斯》的漫畫。","summary":"★壯大的世界觀與錯縱複雜的人物關係\n★史上最強的學園動作科幻故事\n古連丹王家的武藝家庫拉麗貝．隆斯麥亞，也就是庫拉拉，有一件打從心底渴望著的事物。\n那就是──與雷馮來一場決鬥。接二連三挑戰到了最後（庫拉拉單方面的），\n庫拉拉漸漸明白自己對雷馮的情感──\n「使用『這個』，向雷馮進行最後的挑戰！」\n表明決心的她手中握著小瓶子。滿滿裝在那裡面的謎樣液體的藥效，以及庫拉拉的新野心究竟是？\n以擁有天劍繼承者級的力量與技巧的「風暴少女」庫拉拉為中心，\n潔爾妮將要刮起戰鬥與戀情（？）的風暴，將雷馮，菲麗，妮娜等人，\n以及學園都市的人們捲入其中！","series":{"id":"2319","title":"鋼殼都市雷吉歐斯"},"price":"NT$180"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Album Art of Storm Thorgerson","author":["Storm Thorgerson"],"pubdate":"2013-10","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"装帧与设计","title":"装帧与设计"},{"count":1,"name":"艺术与音乐","title":"艺术与音乐"},{"count":1,"name":"(English)","title":"(English)"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27199026.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s27199026.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s27199026.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27199026.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/25809214\/","id":"25809214","publisher":"StormStudios and de Milo.","isbn10":"1905662076","isbn13":"9781905662074","title":"The Gathering Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/25809214","alt_title":"","author_intro":"The story of Storm Thorgerson’s career begins in 1968 as a founder member of the British graphic art group Hipgnosis.

Heavily armoured, highly mobile and capable of killing at over 2500m the M1 Abrams is, to this day, a veritable fighting machine. Superior to both Iraq's Soviet era T-55 and T-62 tanks, nearly all sources claim that no Abrams tank has ever been destroyed by enemy fire. Despite entering service in 1980, the M1 Abrams remained untested in combat until the Gulf War in 1991, where it was to be confronted by its archenemy the Iraqi-assembled Soviet-designed T-72. Entering production in 1971, the T-72 arguably outstripped its contemporaries in a balance of mobility, protection and firepower. By the time of Operation Desert Storm, however, the tables had turned and the tank suffered due to low quality ammunition and poorly trained crews. In this fascinating study, Steven Zaloga pits these two great fighting machines against one another, plotting the development of the Cold War until both tanks met in combat in the deserts of Iraq and Kuwait.","price":"USD 17.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"How to Ride a Dragon's Storm","author":["Cowell, Cressida"],"pubdate":"2011-6","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"writen","title":"writen"},{"count":1,"name":"well","title":"well"},{"count":1,"name":"CressidaCowell","title":"CressidaCowell"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6347336.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"254","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6347336.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6347336.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6347336.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6400249\/","id":"6400249","publisher":"Little Brown UK","isbn10":"031607909X","isbn13":"9780316079099","title":"How to Train Your Dragon Book 7","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6400249","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, everyone's favorite reluctant Viking hero, has three months, five days and six hours to discover America, get back to Berk, save his father, battle Polarserpents, and win the annual Inter-Tribal Friendly Swimming Race.

Crane, Baker Foundation Professor, Harvard Business School       \"Bruner and Carr provide a thorough, masterly, and highly readable account of the 1907 crisis and its management by the great private banker J.

Through the tight lens of four months, Juliet Nicolson’s rich storytelling gifts rivet us with the sights, colors, and feelings of a bygone era. That summer of 1911 a new king was crowned and the aristocracy was at play, bounding from one house party to the next. But perfection was not for all. Cracks in the social fabric were showing. The country was brought to a standstill by industrial strikes. Temperatures rose steadily to more than 100 degrees; by August deaths from heatstroke were too many for newspapers to report. Drawing on material from intimate and rarely seen sources and narrated through the eyes of a series of exceptional individuals — among them a debutante, a choirboy, a politician, a trade unionist, a butler, and the Queen — The Perfect Summer is a vividly rendered glimpse of the twilight of the Edwardian era.","price":"USD 25.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Operation Storm - Secret War in the Middle East","author":["Tony Jeapes"],"pubdate":"2005-4-15","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3968196.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"247","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3968196.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3968196.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3968196.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2949656\/","id":"2949656","publisher":"Greenhill Books","isbn10":"1853675679","isbn13":"9781853675676","title":"SAS","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2949656","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 15.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Rising Storm","author":["Hunter, Erin"],"pubdate":"2004-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7666815.jpg","binding":"LIB","translator":[],"catalog":"","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/56372052\/","pages":"336","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7666815.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7666815.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7666815.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2581607\/","id":"2581607","publisher":"Harpercollins","isbn10":"0060525622","isbn13":"9780060525620","title":"Warriors #4","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2581607","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Fire alone can save our clan...

Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne.

He later completed a Ph.D. in the United States, where he joined a NASA team in the aftermath of the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster to investigate the cause of the disaster and make improvements. He is a happily married family man. September 8, 2002, he became an American citizen.","summary":"Shant Kenderian’s visit to Baghdad in 1980, at age seventeen, was supposed to be a short one —just enough time to make peace with his estranged father before returning to his home in the United States. But then Saddam Hussein invaded Iran and sealed off Iraq’s borders to every man of military age —including Shant. Suddenly forced onto the front lines, his two–week visit turned into a nightmare that lasted for ten years.\n1001 Nights in Iraq presents a human story that provides unique insight into a country and culture that we only get a hint of in the headlines. After surviving the horrors of the Iran–Iraq War, Shant was then forced to fight on the front lines of Desert Storm without being given the proper equipment, including a gun, but miraculously survived to be captured by the Americans and become a POW. He underwent starvation, heavy interrogations, and solitary confinement, but what broke him in the end was his love affair with a female American soldier. Yet throughout this whole ordeal, Shant never lost his respect for people, his faith in God, or his sense of humor.","price":"$15.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Newton Street storm","author":["DENG (Dunkling.J.)

Ruled by the military for half its existence, it has seen three wars with India and the loss of much of its territory. The combination of political instability, deep-seated economic and social problems, and access to nuclear weapons has made it one of the most strategically sensitive countries in the world. The war in neighbouring Afghanistan has placed it at the very centre of global attention and projected its military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, onto the world stage. Musharraf has become the first Pakistani leader in 30 years to dare to confront the country's Islamic extremists. But can he succeed in controlling the forces that helped create the Taliban in Afghanistan and fuelled the bitter conflict in Kashmir? Will his army and intelligence agencies be able to tame the radical elements that they created and sustained? In this history of Pakistan from 1947 to the present, Owen Bennett Jones describes the many fault lines in Pakistani society.  He assesses the role of the nationalists in the provinces, the feudal landlords in the countryside, and the bureaucratic elite in Islamabad, and analyzes the complex relationships between religion, regional politics, and the armed forces. While most Pakistanis have a moderate, tolerant vision of Islam, he argues, the country's central institutions are so weak that the military regime may prove incapable of rescuing the \"failed state\" of Pakistan. As a BBC correspondent in Pakistan between 1998 and 2001 Bennett Jones witnessed at first hand many of the events that brought General Musharraf to power. His book contains the first detailed accounts of the 1999 coup, the Kargil conflict, and how Pakistan came to test its nuclear bomb. It should be of interest to anyone who wants to understand a country that was crucial to the expulsion of Soviet forces from Afghanistan in the 1980s and which, after the 11th September 2001 attack, became a key coalition partner in America's \"war against terrorism\".","price":"USD 35.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Perfect  Storm: Hurricane Katrina, The Bush White House, and Beyond","author":["Michael D.

In 1861, Amelia Martin's father is stripped of his post as a ship's captain when he is caught harboring the leader of a slave rebellion. Now he is an assistant lighthouse keeper on Fenwick Island, off the coast of Delaware -- a state wedged between the North and the South, just as Amelia is wedged between her warring parents. Amelia's mother blames her abolitionist husband for their living conditions, which she claims are taking a toll on her health. Amelia observes her mother's hate and her father's admiration for Abraham Lincoln.      But slavery is the deeper issue separating the two sides. As the Civil War rages on, Amelia slowly learns that she cannot stop the fighting, but by keeping watch in the lighthouse each day, lighting the lamps, cleaning the glass, and rescuing victims of Atlantic storms, she can still make a difference.

Mankel's compelling books about the idealistic police inspector have sold more than 30 million copies in 43 different languages and inspired more than 25 film adaptations. This book explores how in Europe, readers took instantly to the troubled, lonely cop with his horrendous health problems and catastrophic home life. It also demonstrates the new fanbase given the character since Kenneth Branagh has taken on the central role in the acclaimed and award-winning series, and British and American fans have really taken Wallander to their hearts. It discusses the effect on the small Swedish town of Ystad, now one of the country's top tourist attractions as many British and American visitors are lining up to visit murder scenes and immerse themselves in the bleak landscape made famous on screen.

After wild encounters with vicious cannibals, deadly snakes, and tribal kings, Du Chaillu emerged with 20 preserved gorilla skins—two of which were stuffed and brought on tour—and walked smack dab into the biggest scientific debate of the time: Darwin's theory of evolution. Quickly, Du Chaillu's trophies went from objects of wonder to key pieces in an all-out intellectual war.

The book is based on tidal waters of Maryland, Virginia, Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic regions known to the author, and also provides international examples from the UK and different locations around the world, which allows readers to compare and contrast tidal regimes and to perform tidal analysis from data in their own environment. It is an important book for teachers, researchers, planners and engineers responsible for coastal defences as well as new infrastructure and waterway modification in ports and harbours. The wealth of informative detail and data provided makes this text worthwhile for readers who need a wider understanding of this increasingly important topic for coastal zone residents. MATLAB scientific programming language, simple-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI) programs are introduced for students, researchers and engineering consultants, available at no cost from MATLAB Central file exchange (http:\/\/www mathworks.com\/matlabcentral). GUI programs provide the tools for analysing water level or water current observations, deriving the major tidal constituents, and showing first hand how tide and tidal current predictions are made in addition to producing unrivalled colour graphic visualisations. GUI is the author's tidal analysis and is particularly suited for the investigation of storm surge in coastal waters. Professor Boon has studied tidal behaviour in world coastal zones and here assembles information for public and private use from his capacity as advisor to state and federal authorities and corporate organisations.","price":"USD 90.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Storm Clouds over the Pacific, 1931–41","author":["Peter Harmsen"],"pubdate":"2018-12-20","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29756936.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29756936.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29756936.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29756936.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30210974\/","id":"30210974","publisher":"Casemate","isbn10":"1612004806","isbn13":"9781612004808","title":"War in the Asia Pacific","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30210974","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 25.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Storm and Silence Saga Book 1","author":["Robert Thier"],"pubdate":"2016-3-18","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"mobi","title":"mobi"},{"count":1,"name":"Wattpad","title":"Wattpad"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29994884.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"596","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29994884.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29994884.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29994884.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30449676\/","id":"30449676","publisher":"Robert Thier; 1 edition","isbn10":"3000513515","isbn13":"9783000513510","title":"Storm and Silence","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30449676","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Robert Thier is a German Historian and writer of Historical Fiction. His particular mix of history, romance and adventure, always with a good deal of humor thrown in, has gained him a diverse readership ranging from teenagers to retired grandmothers. For the way he manages to make history come alive, as if he himself had lived as a medieval knight, his fans all over the world have given him the nickname “Sir Rob”. For him, Robert says, becoming a writer has followed naturally from his interest in history. “In Germany,” he says, “we use the same word for story and history. And I've always loved the one as much as the other. Becoming a storyteller, a writer, is what I've always wanted.” Besides writing and researching in dusty old archives, on the lookout for a mystery to put into his next story, Robert enjoys classical music and long walks in the country. The helmet you see on the picture he does not wear because he is a cycling enthusiast, but to protect his literary skull in which a bone has been missing from birth. Robert lives in the south of Germany in a small village between the three Emperor's Mountains.","summary":"Freedom – that is what Lilly Linton wants most in life.

The books illustrate the dangers to the individual and to society posed by an incomplete mastery of technology and a misplaced faith in human competence and judgment. The gripping accounts of these tragic events are supplemented with compelling narrative timelines and enthralling firsthand testimonies. Each title includes a discussion of how, in the aftermath of tragedy, changes in technology and procedure were brought about to help ensure that a similar disaster would never strike again. Author Gillian Houghton brings to vivid life the maritime culture of Gloucester, the rough-and-tumble existence on a swordishing boat, and the desperate lives of the swordfishers that make taking dangerous risks with the weather a necessity. Included in this compelling story are first-person observations of the crew's friends and family, accounts of radio messages from the Andrea Gail's captain, and a timeline that charts the ship's last turbulent hours.

In this steamy conclusion to her Stewart Sisters trilogy, JoAnn Ross crafts a sizzling romantic suspense story of sex, sin, and scandal.  There's no escaping the sweltering heat when White House correspondent Laurel Stewart arrives in Somersett, South Carolina, and discovers that her best friend -- the vice president's protocol advisor -- has disappeared. As frustrated as she is by Detective Joe Gannon's skepticism regarding her suspicions, Laurel finds his smooth-talking southern ways and brazen bedroom eyes disturbingly, dangerously, seductive.  With the homicide rate escalating as fast as the mercury, the last thing Joe needs is a stubborn, argumentative reporter -- particularly not an outsider from Washington, D.C., who triggers a sexual jolt at every encounter -- spinning her crazy conspiracy theories. But while he may not entirely believe Laurel Stewart, Joe can't stop himself from wanting her. Thrown together by necessity, drawn together by passion, Laurel and Joe follow a twisted trail into the darkest corners of the sultry, moss-draped city to uncover a secret someone is willing to kill to keep.","price":"59.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"I Feel Like a Storm Cloud","author":["Evans, Lezlie\/ Carrington, Marsha Gray (ILT)"],"pubdate":"1999-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5557152.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5557152.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5557152.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5557152.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2652340\/","id":"2652340","publisher":"Mondo Pub","isbn10":"1572556218","isbn13":"9781572556218","title":"Sometimes I Feel Like a Storm Cloud","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2652340","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Did you ever feel like a storm cloud?Sometimes I feel like a storm cloud -- a big, dark, rumbling, grumbling rain cloud, ready to burst into a shower of tears.

At least 6,000 of the city's 38,000 residents died in the hurricane. Many observers predicted that Galveston would never recover and urged that the island be abandoned. Instead, the citizens of Galveston seized the opportunity, not just to rebuild, but to reinvent the city in a thoughtful, intentional way that reformed its government, gave women a larger role in its public life, and made it less vulnerable to future storms and flooding. This extensively illustrated history tells the full story of the 1900 Storm and its long-term effects. The authors draw on survivors' accounts to vividly recreate the storm and its aftermath. They describe the work of local relief agencies, aided by Clara Barton and the American Red Cross, and show how their short-term efforts grew into lasting reforms. At the same time, the authors reveal that not all Galvestonians benefited from the city's rebirth, as African Americans found themselves increasingly shut out from civic participation by Jim Crow segregation laws. As the centennial of the 1900 Storm prompts remembrance and reassessment, this complete account will be essential and fascinating reading for all who seek to understand Galveston's destruction and rebirth. Patricia Bellis Bixel is a professional historian and assistant editor of the Journal of Southern History at Rice University.

The four Caton sisters were descended from the first settlers in Maryland, and brought up in Baltimore by their grandfather Charles Carroll, one of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence. These Catholic Southern belleswere expected to 'marry a Plantation'. But they were independent, fascinated by politics, clever with money, romantic in mood. Arriving in Britain, Marianne, Louisa and Bess were swept into the set of the Duke of Wellington, who loved Marianne until his death. In London the three sisters forged their own destinies in the face of intense prejudice, against both Americans and Catholics. (Meanwhile, Marianne's sister-in-law Betseyhad married Napoleon's younger brother Joseph, to the Emperor's fury, and found herself abandoned in Paris.) While Emily stayed at home, marrying a Scots-Canadian entrepreneur and running the Baltimore households, the widowed Marianne shocked the world by marrying the Wellington's wayward elder brother, the Duke of Wellesley, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and appearing as a 'Catholic Yankee' among the Protestant Anglo-Irish. Louisa eventually became Duchess of Leeds, and a friend of Queen Victoria, while the sphere in which Bess shone was the stockmarket, as queen of speculators. Based on intimate unpublished letters, Sisters of Fortune is a glorious book. Everything is here -childbirth and coronets, gossip and politics, the call of faith - and, above all, the power of wealth. This is a brilliant portrait of love between sisters and of Anglo-American relations through this period. But it is also a most unusual story of money, of the power it gave these women, particularly over the men in their lives, and how it shaped social and even international relations round them.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Transforming Power of a Storm","author":["Grizzle, Eric

But often it goes misdiagnosed, and kids can be prescribed medication that only worsens the condition. With her twenty-five years’ experience, child psychiatrist Rosalie Greenberg offers parents and professionals alike an innovative approach to help bipolar youngsters locate that elusive inner calm. Gathering stories from families on the front lines, she shows parents how best to navigate the peaks and valleys of the disorder, addresses family relationships, and guides parents in making meaningful choices about their child’s education and treatment options.

Allied with Black Hole, Multiplex, Negative Flash and Raijin, Master of Lightning, Grodd comes to Central City to drain the energy from all of the speedsters!\nIn the back of Barry's mind, Grodd is gnawing at his memories and scratching at scars, inflicting psychic wounds that may have lasting effects. All the Fastest Man Alive can think about is saving the city and freeing Iris West, who is finally beginning to trust Barry again.\nWhen Barry loses his speed, it falls to both Wally Wests and the Flash of China to tackle Grodd and free the city's citizenry. When that proves futile, Barry is willing to cross lines he has never crossed before to regain his speed, and turns to Godspeed for help.

The fourth volume of Melvyn C. Goldstein's History of Modern Tibet series, In the Eye of the Storm, provides new perspectives on Sino-Tibetan history during the period leading to the Tibetan Uprising of 1959. The volume also reassesses issues that have been widely misunderstood as well as stereotypes and misrepresentations in the popular realm and in academic literature (such as in Mao’s policies on Tibet). Volume 4 draws on important new Chinese government documents, published and unpublished memoirs, new biographies, and a large corpus of in-depth, specially collected political interviews to reexamine the events that produced the March 10th uprising and the demise of Tibet’s famous Buddhist civilization. The result is a heavily documented analysis that presents a nuanced and balanced account of the principal players and their policies during the critical final two years of Sino-Tibetan relations under the Seventeen-Point Agreement of 1951.","price":"$85"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":84,"average":"9.7","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["George R.R.

Martin sold his first story in 1971 and has been writing professionally ever since. He has written fantasy, horror, and science fiction, and for his sins spent ten years in Hollywood as a writer\/producer, working on Twilight Zone, Beauty and the Beast, and various feature films and television pilots that were never made. In the mid 90s he returned to prose, his first love, and began work on his epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. He has been in the Seven Kingdoms ever since. Whenever he's allowed to leave, he returns to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lives with the lovely Parris, a big white dog called Mischa, and two cats named Augustus and Caligula who think they run the place.","summary":"《冰与火之歌》英国版\nSplit into two books for the paperback, the third volume in George R.R. Martin's superb and highly acclaimed epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire continues the richest, most exotic and mesmerising saga since The Lord of the Rings. The Seven Kingdoms are divided by revolt and blood feud, and winter approaches like an angry beast. Beyond the Northern borders, wildlings leave their villages to gather in the ice and stone wasteland of the Frostfangs. From there, the renegade Brother Mance Rayder will lead them South towards the Wall. Robb Stark wears his new-forged crown in the Kingdom of the North, but his defences are ranged against attack from the South, the land of House Stark's enemies the Lannisters. His sisters are trapped there, dead or likely yet to die, at the whim of the Lannister boy-king Joffrey or his depraved mother Cersei, regent of the Iron Throne. And Daenerys Stormborn will return to the land of her birth to avenge the murder of her father, the last Dragon King on the Iron Throne.","series":{"id":"5913","title":"A Song of Ice and Fire"},"price":"£8.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":15,"average":"7.8","min":0},"subtitle":"1400年的伊斯蘭聖戰","author":["米爾頓·費歐斯特(Viorst, Milton )"],"pubdate":"2009\/3\/1","tags":[{"count":15,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":11,"name":"中东","title":"中东"},{"count":8,"name":"伊斯兰","title":"伊斯兰"},{"count":6,"name":"歷史","title":"歷史"},{"count":3,"name":"宗教","title":"宗教"},{"count":3,"name":"2009","title":"2009"},{"count":2,"name":"MiltonViorst","title":"MiltonViorst"},{"count":2,"name":"2013","title":"2013"}],"origin_title":"Storm from the East: The Struggle Between the Arab World and the Christian West","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3672381.jpg","binding":"平裝本","translator":["謝佩妏"],"catalog":"地圖\n前言\n1古老記憶　622-1900\n2挺身反抗　1901-1918\n3理想幻滅　1919-1939\n4解放之路　1940-1956\n5分分合合　1957-1967\n6神權政治與獨裁政治　1968-2005\n結語\n資料來源\n注解","pages":"256頁","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3672381.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3672381.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3672381.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3611775\/","id":"3611775","publisher":"左岸文化事業有限公司","isbn10":"9866723186","isbn13":"9789866723186","title":"以阿拉之名","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3611775","alt_title":"Storm from the East: The Struggle Between the Arab World and the Christian West","author_intro":"米爾頓．費歐斯特\n是《紐約客》雜誌的中東特派員，從一九六○年代開始報導中東新聞。他也是該領域的學者，作品散見於《紐約時報》、《華盛頓郵報》、《洛杉磯時報》和《華爾街日報》等報章。至今已出版六本中東方面的著作。目前跟妻子，詩人茱蒂?費歐斯特，住在華盛頓特區。\n譯者簡介\n謝佩妏\n譯有《城市的歷史》《失敗的國家》《微國家》《美的線條》","summary":"資深記者及中東學者米爾頓‧費歐斯特，清楚明白、持平生動地勾勒出美國與阿拉伯世界之間多年來的恩恩怨怨。他認為，除非美國以首的西方國家，尊重阿拉伯人想要自己決定命運的決心，不然中東地區發生的激烈衝突不可能緩和。\n作者在書中紀錄了西方和中東阿拉伯世界之間，長達一千四百年的往來互動，深入探討阿拉伯人設法推翻西方霸權的長期抗爭過程。此外，他也描繪阿拉伯人經歷過的民主政治和軍事獨裁統治，並細細推論納瑟社會主義、阿拉伯復興主義、伊斯蘭教的極端主義等政治運動，為何都擁有同樣的目標：解放阿拉伯人，掙脫外強的控制。","price":"NT$ 280"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":9,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Childhood Lost in Chaos","author":["Emily Wu","Larry Engelmann"],"pubdate":"2008-1-8","tags":[{"count":15,"name":"回忆录","title":"回忆录"},{"count":11,"name":"传记","title":"传记"},{"count":9,"name":"文革","title":"文革"},{"count":7,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":6,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":4,"name":"中国近代史","title":"中国近代史"},{"count":3,"name":"中国","title":"中国"},{"count":3,"name":"Memoir","title":"Memoir"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29274780.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"333","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29274780.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29274780.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29274780.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3817303\/","id":"3817303","publisher":"Anchor","isbn10":"0307276627","isbn13":"9780307276629","title":"Feather in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3817303","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 17.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":49,"average":"7.6","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["David Gemmell"],"pubdate":"2001-1-30","tags":[{"count":16,"name":"奇幻","title":"奇幻"},{"count":10,"name":"科幻世界译文版","title":"科幻世界译文版"},{"count":10,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":6,"name":"DavidGemmell","title":"DavidGemmell"},{"count":5,"name":"英国","title":"英国"},{"count":4,"name":"David_Gemmell","title":"David_Gemmell"},{"count":3,"name":"科幻世界•译文版","title":"科幻世界•译文版"},{"count":3,"name":"奇幻小说","title":"奇幻小说"}],"origin_title":"Sword in the Storm","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4587750.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"439","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4587750.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4587750.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4587750.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2717647\/","id":"2717647","publisher":"Del Rey","isbn10":"0345432347","isbn13":"9780345432346","title":"暴风雨之剑","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2717647","alt_title":"Sword in the Storm","author_intro":"","summary":"Fierce and proud, the Rigante dwell deep in the green mountain lands, worshiping the gods of air and water, and the spirits of the earth.

Carlin），「硬底子歷史」（Hardcore History）網站主持人\n幽默的筆法與說故事的本能，造就了鄧肯這位廣受歡迎的播客製作者。他以精采的方式回答了一個鮮少被提出的重要問題：是什麼削弱了羅馬共和國晚期的國力，以致於羅馬在凱撒的野心之下滅亡？這是貨真價實的歷史故事，機智、有說服力，並且揭露最終真相。──拉爾斯．布朗沃思（Lars Brownworth），「中古歐洲三部曲」作者\n從來沒有一本談論兩千年前歷史的書籍，出現得如此即時。鄧肯如敘事散文般的口吻，使他的播客節目觸動了世界各地愛好歷史人士；他訴說羅馬共和國衰敗的故事，書中每一頁都顯露出歷史故事與當代的關聯性。從煽動民粹主義的政客利用經濟與社會不平等的生動描述，到僵化的共和國政體適應環境改變的失敗，在《在風暴來臨之前》中都有生動的描述。正如同閱讀任何一份報紙，讀者也能在本書中看到我們今日面對的問題。──班傑明．衛慈（Benjamin Wittes），「洛菲爾」（Lawfare）部落格主編，美國布魯金斯學會（Brookings Institution）高級研究員\n麥克．鄧肯以他清晰而迷人的敘事才華，娓娓道出被低估的一段羅馬史：在凱撒崛起與誕生羅馬帝國的痛苦內戰之前，那段共和國最後的歲月。鄧肯機智與通順易讀的寫作風格，以及他著眼於生動的細節與難忘的軼事，將讀者帶入他引人入勝的故事中。──彼德．亞當森（Peter

That's taught as fact in psychology textbooks, academic journals, and bestselling books. And these hardwired differences explain everything from sexual orientation to gender identity, to why there aren't more women physicists or more stay-at-home dads. In this compelling book, Rebecca Jordan-Young takes on the evidence that sex differences are hardwired into the brain. Analyzing virtually all published research that supports the claims of 'human brain organization theory,' Jordan-Young reveals how often these studies fail the standards of science. Even if careful researchers point out the limits of their own studies, other researchers and journalists can easily ignore them because brain organization theory just sounds so right. But if a series of methodological weaknesses, questionable assumptions, inconsistent definitions, and enormous gaps between ambiguous findings and grand conclusions have accumulated through the years, then science isn't scientific at all. Elegantly written, this book argues passionately that the analysis of gender differences deserves far more rigorous, biologically sophisticated science. \"The evidence for hormonal sex differentiation of the human brain better resembles a hodge-podge pile than a solid structure...Once we have cleared the rubble, we can begin to build newer, more scientific stories about human development.\"","price":"USD 22.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":6,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Ernst Jünger"],"pubdate":"2004-5-4","tags":[{"count":5,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":4,"name":"德国","title":"德国"},{"count":4,"name":"Ernst_Jünger","title":"Ernst_Jünger"},{"count":2,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":2,"name":"文学","title":"文学"},{"count":2,"name":"德国文学","title":"德国文学"},{"count":2,"name":"一战","title":"一战"},{"count":1,"name":"汉斯","title":"汉斯"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3531042.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":["Michael Hofmann"],"catalog":"","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3531042.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3531042.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3531042.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1753314\/","id":"1753314","publisher":"Penguin Classics","isbn10":"0142437905","isbn13":"9780142437902","title":"Storm of Steel","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1753314","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"‘As though walking through a deep dream, I saw steel helmets approaching through the craters.

'Russian success has been somewhat aided by the strategy of Herr Hitler, of Corporal Hitler,' Churchill jibed. 'Even military idiots find it difficult not to see some faults in his actions.'\nAndrew Roberts's previous book Masters and Commanders studied the creation of Allied grand strategy; Beating Corporal Hitler now analyses how Axis strategy evolved. Examining the Second World War on every front, Roberts asks whether, with a different decision-making process and a different strategy, the Axis might even have won. Were those German generals who blamed everything on Hitler after the war correct, or were they merely scapegoating their former F黨rer once he was safely beyond defending himself?\nIn researching this uniquely vivid history of the Second World War Roberts has walked many of the key battlefield and wartime sites of Russia, France, Italy, Germany and the Far East. The book is full of illuminating sidelights on the principle actors that bring their characters and the ways in which they reached decisions into fresh focus.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":17,"average":"9.7","min":0},"subtitle":"A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three","author":["George R.

In the mid 90s he returned to prose, his first love, and began work on his epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. He has been in the Seven Kingdoms ever since. Whenever he's allowed to leave, he returns to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lives with the lovely Parris, a big white dog called Mischa, and two cats named Augustus and Caligula who think they run the place.","summary":"Rarely has there been a tale as gripping, or one as likely to seize the minds and hearts of a generation, as George R. R. Martin's epic high fantasy series. In A Game of Thrones, an ancient kingdom was torn by the ambitions of ruthless men and women; in A Clash of Kings, war, sorcery, and madness swept over the kingdom like a voracious beast of prey. Now, as the brutal struggle for power nears its tumultuous climax, the battered and divided kingdom faces its most terrifying invasion--one that is being spearheaded from beyond the grave....\nA Storm Of Swords\nOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. Filled with the stench of death and decay from the destructive dynastic war, Daenerys is gathering allies and strength for an assault on King's Landing, hoping to win back the crown she believes is rightfully hers. But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings bent on overwhelming the Seven Kingdoms arrives from the outermost lineof civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. And as the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest in the quest for victory until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords....Brilliantly conceived and grand in scope, A Storm of Swords is the incredible tale of a world of harsh beauty and powerful magic, torn by treachery, ravaged by brutality, and consumed by greed and ambition. It portrays a war-torn landscape in which nobles and commoners, heroes and villains, the freeborn and the enslaved, all struggle to survive and to find their destinies...along with the dazzling bounty and wondrous enchantment that was once their birthright in the Seven Kingdoms.","price":"$28.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":10,"average":"8.9","min":0},"subtitle":"and Other Stories (Perennial Classics)","author":["Gabriel García Márquez"],"pubdate":"2005-02-01","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"Garbriel-Garcia-Marquez","title":"Garbriel-Garcia-Marquez"},{"count":1,"name":"鬼知道什么时候才会读到","title":"鬼知道什么时候才会读到"},{"count":1,"name":"英语","title":"英语"},{"count":1,"name":"短篇小说","title":"短篇小说"},{"count":1,"name":"novella","title":"novella"},{"count":1,"name":"On_My_Shelf","title":"On_My_Shelf"},{"count":1,"name":"Latin_America","title":"Latin_America"},{"count":1,"name":"Gabriel_García_Márquez","title":"Gabriel_García_Márquez"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2799157.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":["Gregory Rabassa"],"catalog":"","pages":"160","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s2799157.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s2799157.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2799157.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2340733\/","id":"2340733","publisher":"Harper Perennial","isbn10":"006075155X","isbn13":"9780060751555","title":"Leaf Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2340733","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Gabriel García Márquez was born in 1927 in the town of Aracataca, Columbia.Latin America's preeminent man of letters, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982.

And mankind is not ready. The final volume of the Wheel of Time, \"A Memory of Light, \" was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson, \"New York Times\" bestselling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan's editor---his wife, Harriet McDougal---to complete the final book. The scope and size of the volume was such that it could not be contained in a single book, and so Tor proudly presents \"The Gathering Storm\" as the first of three novels that will make up \"A Memory of Light.\" This short sequence will complete the struggle against the Shadow, bringing to a close a journey begun almost twenty years ago and marking the conclusion of the Wheel of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era. In this epic novel, Robert Jordan's international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward---wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders---his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself. Egwene al'Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower---and possibly the world itself. The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.","series":{"id":"26003","title":"The Wheel of Time"},"price":"$17.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Memoir of Ch'en Li-Fu, 1900-1993","author":["Lifu Chen, Sidney H.

Chen served as the private secretary and close confidant of Chiang Kaishek, president of the Republic of China, holding important official posts during the momentous years from 1926 to 1950. His recollection encompasses the titanic struggle between the Kuomintang (the Chinese National party) and the Chinese Communist party. To this day, no high-ranking member from either party has published memoirs of the period; and Chen thus provides invaluable portrayals of some of the personalities who shaped the destiny of modern China. In the early 1920s, Chen came to the United States to study mining engineering at the University of Pittsburgh. After gaining practical experience as a coal miner in Pittsburgh and Scranton, Chen returned to China. His uncle Ying-shih, a follower of Sun Yat-sen and military governor of Shanghai, had been a patron of the young Chiang Kai-shek, and his older brother, Kuo-fu, was then deeply involved in preparing for the forthcoming Nationalist Revolution; these connections gained Chen Li-fu a position as private secretary to Chiang. Chen's loyalty and outstanding abilities won Chiang's absolute trust. Over the following quarter century, Chen enjoyed considerable political influence as he advanced through several important official positions. In March 1926, after a communist plot to kill Chiang failed, Chen became an ardent anti-Communist. The memoir reveals that further attempts on Chiang's life convinced Chiang and his colleagues that the Communists had to be destroyed, a decision that launchedthe April 1927 purge of the Communists from the Kuomintang in which Chen played a major role. Chen's unique account presents new information about Chiang Kai-shek's arrest of Kuomintang veteran Hu Han-min in March 1931, an act which fatally split the Kuomintang and set the stage for a decline in the Kuomintang's prestige and authority and its loss of popular support. Chen also sheds new light on Wang Ching-wei's flight to Hanoi in 1938 and Li Tsung-jen and his Kwangsi clique's opposition to Chiang during the civil war from 1945 to 1949. Chen, who served Chiang Kai-shek loyally and capably, still believes that Chiang was the most suitable person to lead China in those stormy decades. He does not hesitate, however, to expose Chiang's character, his temper, or his ambition. With candor and clarity he describes the personality clashes, the internal power struggles, economic reforms, and difficulties in handling foreign affairs that ultimately led to the defeat of the Kuomintang and the ignominious retreat of the Nationalist government to Taiwan in 1949.","price":"GBP 19.63"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm Thorgerson","Peter Curzon"],"pubdate":"2007-10-30","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"Storm_Thorgerson","title":"Storm_Thorgerson"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4180006.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4180006.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4180006.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4180006.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2515239\/","id":"2515239","publisher":"Vision On","isbn10":"1846096677","isbn13":"9781846096679","title":"Taken By Storm (Omnibus Press)","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2515239","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Thorgerson's prolific album art is presented in full-colour and includes in-depth analysis of each image including the themes and motivations that inspired the work as well as the practical details involved in producing each stunning image.

He thinks he has found it under the seat of a notorious pirate Torrents, who catches Jack stealing. In the ensuing bar fight, Jack slips out, only to find out that the satchel isn't his. This one contains, among various personal items, the magical sheath for the Sword of Cortés. The bar attendant, Arabella, who pulled Jack out of the fight, makes this discovery with him. They plan together to a ship to go look for the storied Sword of Cortés, and reunite it with its sheath. Arabella directs Jack to an abandoned ship, the Barnacle. Before they leave Tortuga, a young boy, Fitzwilliam P. Dalton III, insists on joining them for their quest. The three sail for many days and come upon an island, where they meet two thirteen year old boys, Jean and Tumen, and their cat sister Constance. Jack remarks about The Sword of Cortés, and Jean and Tumen lead the crew to a 'dead' city on the cursed island. Inside the main building of the city, the crew find the skeleton of the city's king, Stone-Eyed Sam, who is said to be holding the Sword, but it is missing. Jack pockets the fabled stone eye of the now-dead former pirate king as a souvenir. The crew find left footprints on the ground, and soon realize that the notorious pirate, Left Foot Louis, has it. They all go rushing to the Barnacle, when they suddenly come face to face with Torrents, a crew member of the feared Davy Jones's crew. They all battle on the beach, for who would get the Sword of Cortés's sheath, and Jack eventually defeats Torrents (look out for a reference to Ben Franklin!) and escape on the Barnacle.\n\nIt is revealed in this book that Jack knew Benjamin Franklin, and taught him the secrets of electricity.\n\n  \nlength: (cm)18.9    　　　            　　　　　            　　　　　 width:(cm)14.5","price":"42.42"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Images of Pink Floyd","author":["Storm Thorgerson","Peter Curzon"],"pubdate":"2003-03-03","tags":[{"count":4,"name":"Storm_Thorgerson","title":"Storm_Thorgerson"},{"count":1,"name":"音乐","title":"音乐"},{"count":1,"name":"设计","title":"设计"},{"count":1,"name":"装帧与设计","title":"装帧与设计"},{"count":1,"name":"艺术与音乐","title":"艺术与音乐"},{"count":1,"name":"*灵光","title":"*灵光"},{"count":1,"name":"*弦外","title":"*弦外"},{"count":1,"name":"(English)","title":"(English)"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1648354.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"192","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s1648354.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s1648354.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1648354.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1777240\/","id":"1777240","publisher":"Sanctuary Publishing, Ltd.","isbn10":"1860748333","isbn13":"9781860748332","title":"Mind over Matter","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1777240","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Contains exclusive stories behind the images of nearly all of Pink Floyd's albums including A Saucerful of Secrets, Atom Heart Mother, The Dark Side  of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Division Bell amongst  others.

Formed by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell in London in 1968 (with the addition of Throbbing Gristle's Peter Christopherson in 1974), Hipgnosis specialized in creative photography for the music business, making classic album covers for bands and musicians like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Electric Light Orchestra, Genesis, 10cc, Yes, Peter Gabriel, The Gods, Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Paul McCartney, Syd Barrett, Scorpions and Styx, among others. Over the course of its 15 year existence, Hipgnosis produced timeless rock iconography--everybody knows at least one Hipgnosis cover, thanks to Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" The firm's inventive takes on the themes or titles of any given album opened up a new visual language in album cover art, one in which theatrical tableaux, trick photography and logo design played notable roles. \"For the Love of Vinyl\" is the first book to survey Storm and Powell's output in detail, focusing on more than 60 package designs--from cover to label--described with entertaining detail by the team who created them. Also included are short essays by musicians (such as Pink Floyd's Nick Mason and artists (British Pop artist Peter Blake) and fellow designers (Paula Scher) on their favorite Hipgnosis covers, as well as previously unseen photographs and ephemera. Complementing all this material is a lengthy critical-historical text examining Hipgnosis and its legacy. \"For the Love of Vinyl\" is \"the\" rock book of 2008.

In den dän.-dt. Auseinandersetzungen 1848–52 engagierte er sich publizistisch und dichterisch und verlor 1852 wegen seiner antidän. Betätigung seine Zulassung als Anwalt. 1853 trat er als Assessor in den preußischen Staatsdienst ein und zog nach Potsdam; von hier aus hatte er Kontakt zu dem literarischen Verein »Tunnel über der Spree« in Berlin (Th. Fontane, P. Heyse, mit dem sich eine Freundschaft entwickelte, u. a.). 1856 wurde er Kreisrichter in Heiligenstadt. Nach der dän. Niederlage 1864 kehrte S. als Landvogt nach Husum zurück. 1867–80 war er Amtsrichter im preußischen Schleswig; ein Jahr nach der Pensionierung zog er nach Hademarschen. S. selbst stellte die Lyrik immer an die erste Stelle seines Schaffens und behauptete, auch seine Novellistik sei aus seiner Lyrik erwachsen. Sein lyrisches Werk ist durch die Beschränkung auf das Private und Individuelle gekennzeichnet, mit der Absicht, darin »das möglichst Allgemeine« auszusagen: »Gelegenheitsgedicht im höhern Sinne.« Das Lyrische versteht er als »Naturlaut der Seele«, wobei sich aus der lyrischen Empﬁndung die Form von selbst ergebe. Schwerpunkte bilden Naturgedichte, bei denen Stimmungen der Einsamkeit und der Trauer dominieren, und Liebesgedichte, in denen sich die Evokation von Liebe und tabuloser Leidenschaft kontrapunktisch mit Gedanken an Vergänglichkeit, Abschied und Tod verbindet. Als Stimmungsbilder und aus der Gelegenheit hervorgehende Schöpfungen erscheinen auch viele seiner (insgesamt mehr als 50) Novellen, die in der Regel zuerst in Zeitschriften erschienen. Sie sind meist nicht von der Formstrenge bestimmt, die S.s eigene Charakterisierung der Novelle als Schwester des Dramas nahelegt. Es herrschen vielmehr atmosphärische, landschaftliche, von Erinnerungen stimmungshaft geprägte Elemente vor, die wiederum auf die Erfahrung der Vergänglichkeit verweisen. Von der Stimmungskunst früher Novellen wie Immensee entwickelt sich S.s Novellistik in zwei Richtungen: einerseits zur Einbeziehung sozialer Fragen, psychologischer Konﬂikte und aktueller Themen (Vererbung, Kriminalität u. a.), andererseits zur historischen Novelle, die durch die Art der erzählerisch komplexen Annäherung die ›Wahrheit‹ des vergangenen Geschehens in Frage stellt und zugleich Vergangenheit und Gegenwart verbindet (Aquis submersus, Der Schimmelreiter u. a.).","summary":"","price":"2,10 EUR"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bucquoye, Moniek E","Storm, Dieter Van Den"],"pubdate":"2008\/05\/01","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"设计","title":"设计"},{"count":1,"name":"inds","title":"inds"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3235139.jpg","binding":"精裝","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"156","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3235139.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3235139.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3235139.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3193167\/","id":"3193167","publisher":"PAGE ONE PUBLISHING PTE LTD","isbn10":"9812457038","isbn13":"9789812457035","title":"FORMS WITH A SMILE","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3193167","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"每當提到「超現實主義」(surrealism ) 時，大部份所聯想到的都是一種文學或藝術風格，但事實上，超現實主義在其它領域的影響力也是不容忽視的。在當代的設計領域中，我們經常也可以發現超現實主義的蹤跡，以一種獨有的幽默形式出現。\n本書收錄現代的超現實主義藝術家作品，這些超乎我們想像的作品包括：長毛地毯、在牛奶瓶裡的燈、木枝形狀的 USB 隨身碟、用絨毛玩具做成的椅字…等等。如果要說這些作品很幽默，還不如說它們帶有一種傳染性：會讓人看了之後會忍不住微笑。\n超現實主義的設計並不只是我們想像中的設計作品那麼簡單，設計師在他們的作品中都加入了某些詼諧而帶有微妙諷刺性的「意見」，他們用作品向世界大聲吶喊：誰說一定要凡事都那麼認真呢？","price":"280.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"台版译作《阳性反应》","author":["Paul Russell"],"pubdate":"2000-9-9","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":2,"name":"LGBT","title":"LGBT"},{"count":1,"name":"黑色幽默","title":"黑色幽默"},{"count":1,"name":"青春","title":"青春"},{"count":1,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":1,"name":"教育学","title":"教育学"},{"count":1,"name":"人类学","title":"人类学"},{"count":1,"name":"PaulRussell","title":"PaulRussell"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2717727.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"371","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s2717727.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s2717727.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2717727.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2264544\/","id":"2264544","publisher":"Stonewall Inn Editions","isbn10":"0312263031","isbn13":"9780312263034","title":"The Coming Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2264544","alt_title":"","author_intro":"保羅．羅素（Paul Russell）2000年的得獎（Ferro-Grumley Award之Fiction类）作品。Triangle Awards是由Publishing Triangle和The Robert Chesley Foundation共同舉辦的文學獎，每年在春天公佈並頒獎給當年度同志相關的小說、非小說和詩集...等類別，而The Ferro-Grumley Awards則是其中一項，頒給年度最佳男、女同志小說（recognize excellence and experiment in literary fiction）。\n作品简介：\n校規嚴謹的著名貴族中學來了一位新老師──崔西。他年輕而熱情，活力十足且不拘小節，甚至有點不修邊幅。然而謹言慎行的拘謹校長路易士卻對他眷顧有加。崔西是個素食主義者，但他對年輕美好的同性肉體卻有無法饜足的渴求。帶著可能被舊日親密愛侶傳染愛滋的恐懼，他離開紐約這顆大蘋果，在校園中扮演形象良好的聖者，跟保守的福克中學一樣壓抑而自制。然而，在學生諾亞的主動與大膽告白下，他們突破同性與師生的禁忌。在夏日裡曖?滋生的不倫之戀，逐漸成長而終將無法遮掩。在冬日鋪天蓋地的暴風雪中，福克中學也正蘊釀一場醜聞風暴。福克中學的永久典範──死去的老校長艾米瑞奇，終其一身隱藏自己；一板一眼的現任校長路易士將熱情投注在教育與音樂。走過風暴，崔西與諾亞又做出怎樣驚人的抉擇。","summary":"Set against the backdrop of a traditional boys' school in upstate New York, \"The Coming Storm\" is a delicately and brilliantly rendered tale that reveals the most closely held secrets of the human heart.

Artists, architects, poets, inventors, scientists, and others all navigate the same stages of the process in order to discover something that does not yet exist. All of us must work our way through the empty page, the blank screen, writer’s block, confusion, chaos, and doubt. In this book, Leski draws from her observations and experiences as a teacher, student, maker, writer, and architect to describe the workings of the creative process.\nLeski sees the creative process as being like a storm; it slowly begins to gather and take form until it overtakes us—if we are willing to let it. It is dynamic, continually in motion; it starts, stops, rages and abates, ebbs and flows. In illustrations that accompany each chapter, she maps the arc of the creative process by tracing the path of water droplets traveling the stages of a storm.\nLeski describes unlearning, ridding ourselves of preconceptions; only when we realize what we don’t know can we pose the problem that we need to solve. We gather evidence—with notebook jottings, research, the collection of objects—propelling the process. We perceive and conceive; we look ahead without knowing where we are going; we make connections. We pause, retreat, and stop, only to start again. To illustrate these stages of the process, Leski draws on examples of creative practice that range from Paul Klee to Steve Jobs, from the discovery of continental drift to the design of Antoni Gaudí’s Sagrada Familia.\nCreativity, Leski tells us, is a path with no beginning or end; it is ongoing. This revelatory view of the creative process will be an essential guide for anyone engaged in creative discovery.","price":"USD 24.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":9,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Lincoln Child"],"pubdate":"2008-2-26","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"科幻","title":"科幻"},{"count":2,"name":"海洋","title":"海洋"},{"count":2,"name":"悬疑小说","title":"悬疑小说"},{"count":2,"name":"Lincoln_Child","title":"Lincoln_Child"},{"count":1,"name":"译林杂志","title":"译林杂志"},{"count":1,"name":"航海","title":"航海"},{"count":1,"name":"欧美惊悚悬疑","title":"欧美惊悚悬疑"},{"count":1,"name":"文学","title":"文学"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4666477.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"432","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4666477.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4666477.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4666477.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3506655\/","id":"3506655","publisher":"Anchor","isbn10":"1400095476","isbn13":"9781400095476","title":"Deep Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3506655","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In this explosive new thriller, one of the most incredible and frightening discoveries mankind has ever faced is about to surface.\n\nOn an oil platform in the middle of the North Atlantic, a terrifying series of illnesses is spreading through the crew.

Although Dobrowner's work is widely exhibited, collected and published in periodicals, this is the first book featuring his storm photographs.","summary":"Mitch Dobrowner has been chasing storms since 2009, traveling throughout Western and Midwestern America to capture nature in its full fury. Making photographs in the tradition of Ansel Adams, to the highest standard of craftsmanship, Dobrowner creates extraordinary black-and-white images of monsoons, tornados and massive thunderstorms conjure awe and wonder. As Dobrowner states in the book's afterword, \"I experience storms as living beings, organic things, both rational and unpredictable in the way they look, how they move, grow and die.

In \"Storms of My Grandchildren,\" Dr. James Hansen--the nation's leading scientist on climate issues--speaks out for the first time with the full truth about global warming: The planet is hurtling even more rapidly than previously acknowledged to a climatic point of no return. Although the threat of human-caused climate change is now widely recognized, politicians have failed to connect policy with the science, responding instead with ineffectual remedies dictated by special interests. Hansen shows why President Obama's solution, cap-and-trade, which Al Gore has signed on to, won't work; why we must phase out all coal, and why 350 ppm of carbon dioxide is a goal we must achieve if our children and grandchildren are to avoid global meltdown and the storms of the book's title. This urgent manifesto bucks conventional wisdom (including the Kyoto Protocol) and is sure to stir controversy, but Hansen--whose climate predictions have come to pass again and again, beginning in the 1980s when he first warned Congress about global warming--is the single most credible voice on the subject worldwide. Hansen paints a devastating but all-too-realistic picture of what will happen in the near future, mere years and decades from now, if we follow the course we're on. But he is also an optimist, showing that there is still time to do what we need to save the planet. Urgent, strong action is needed, and this book, released to coincide with the Copenhagen Conference in December 2009, will be key in setting the agenda going forward to create a groundswell, a tipping point, to save humanity--and our grandchildren--from a dire fate more imminent than we had supposed.

Martin sold his first story in 1971 and has been writing professionally ever since. He has written fantasy, horror, and science fiction, and for his sins spent ten years in Hollywood as a writer\/producer, working on Twilight Zone, Beauty and the Beast, and various feature films and television pilots that were never made. In the mid 90s he returned to prose, his first love, and began work on his epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. He has been in the Seven Kingdoms ever since. Whenever he's allowed to leave, he returns to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lives with the lovely Parris, a big white dog called Mischa, and two cats named Augustus and Caligula who think they run the place.\nBiography\nAs a child growing up in New Jersey, George R.R. Martin displayed an early interest in \"the writing life\" by selling monster stories of his own invention to the children in his Bayonne neighborhood. In high school he became an avid comic book collector and began to write for comic fanzines. He sold his first story to Galaxy in 1970 when he was 21 years old.\nMartin received his bachelor's and master's degrees in journalism from Northwestern University. After graduation he served two years in VISTA, then worked as a teacher and chess tournament director in the Midwest, while continuing to craft award-winning short fiction. His first full-length novel, Dying of the Light, was published in 1977. A dark, lyrical sci-fi tone poem set on a doomed world without a sun, the book was nominated for a Hugo Award.\nThroughout the 1980s, Martin worked in television, writing for science fiction- and fantasy-themed shows like The Twilight Zone and Beauty and the Beast. At this time he became involved with Wild Cards, a long-running anthology series composed of \"mosaic stories\" written by multiple authors and set in a shared universe. In addition to editing the series, Martin has contributed stories to the Wild Card books.\nIn 1996, Martin published A Game of Thrones, the first installment of his magnum opus, the epic fantasy series A Song of Fire and Ice. Set in the Seven Kingdoms, a realm resembling medieval Europe, the internationally bestselling series has provided the ultimate showcase for Martin's formidable world-building and characterization skills.\nDuring the course of his long, prolific career, Martin has accrued every major literary prize for science fiction or fantasy writing, including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Bram Stoker, Daedelus, and Locus awards. But what endears him especially to his readers is his extraordinary accessibility. A tireless participant in genre conventions and festivals, he maintains a cordial relationship with his fans through his website and blog. He is also a member of the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America.","summary":"Here is the third volume in George R. R. Martin's magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R. R. Martin's stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.\nA Storm of Swords\nOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world....\nBut as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others--a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the SevenKingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords. . .","price":"USD 9.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Ernst Junger"],"pubdate":"2004-8-3","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"军事","title":"军事"},{"count":3,"name":"一战","title":"一战"},{"count":2,"name":"英语","title":"英语"},{"count":2,"name":"EnstJunger","title":"EnstJunger"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"Penguin","title":"Penguin"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28644631.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28644631.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28644631.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28644631.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3547602\/","id":"3547602","publisher":"Penguin Classic","isbn10":"0141186917","isbn13":"9780141186917","title":"STORM OF STEEL","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3547602","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Ernst Jünger (1895-1998) the son of a wealthy chemist, ran away from home to join the Foreign Legion. His father dragged him back, but he returned to military service when he joined the German army on the outbreak of the First World War. Storm of Steel (Stahlgewittern) was Jünger's first book, published in 1920. Greatly admired by the Nazis, Jünger remained at a distance from the regime, with books such as his allegorical work On the Marble Cliffs (1939) functioning as a covert criticism of Nazi ideology and methods.","summary":"Presenting the desperate conflict of the First World War through the eyes of an ordinary German soldier, Ernst Jünger's Storm of Steel is translated by Michael Hofmann in Penguin Modern Classics.\n'As though walking through a deep dream, I saw steel helmets approaching through the craters. They seemed to sprout from the fire-harrowed soil like some iron harvest.'\nA memoir of astonishing power, savagery and ashen lyricism, Storm of Steel depicts Ernst Jünger's experience of combat on the front line - leading raiding parties, defending trenches against murderous British incursions, and simply enduring as shells tore his comrades apart. One of the greatest books to emerge from the catastrophe of the First World War, it illuminates like no other book not only the horrors but also the fascination of a war that made men keep fighting for four long years.","price":"USD 22.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":9,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["B’s‐LOG COLLECTION"],"pubdate":"2010年9月17日","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"—原画集と公式书と资料设定集—","title":"—原画集と公式书と资料设定集—"},{"count":2,"name":"画集","title":"画集"},{"count":2,"name":"公式书","title":"公式书"},{"count":1,"name":"菊家","title":"菊家"},{"count":1,"name":"畫集","title":"畫集"},{"count":1,"name":"待入荷","title":"待入荷"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6420364.jpg","binding":"大型本","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"167","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6420364.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6420364.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6420364.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5299393\/","id":"5299393","publisher":"エンターブレイン","isbn10":"4047268038","isbn13":"9784047268036","title":"STORM LOVER 公式ビジュアルファンブック","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5299393","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"恋は付き合ってからが本番!!!\n素敵な彼氏との甘い学園生活を送れる『STORM LOVER』待望のファンブックが登場!!　告白あり、バカップルあり、倦怠期ありのリアルな恋愛模様を余すことなく楽しめる恋の指南をバッチリサポートしちゃいます☆　スペシャル企画としてキャストの羽多野渉さん、寺島拓篤さんの対談、梶裕貴さん、三浦祥朗さん、浪川大輔さんの鼎談、宮野真守さんの単独インタビューと見どころ読みどころ満載です!!　また原画家の川人やすたけさんによる描き下ろしイラストや開発者インタビューも掲載！　さらに声優陣のサイン入りポラロイドを抽選で10名にプレゼント!!　お見逃しなく♪\n美麗CGを完全収録したCGギャラリー、データリスト完備の攻略情報、開発者鼎談インタビューなど見どころ満載の公式ビジュアルファンブック。","price":" 2,940"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":7,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A True Story of Men Against the Sea","author":["Sebastian Junger"],"pubdate":"1998-07-01","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":1,"name":"纪实文学","title":"纪实文学"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"to","title":"to"},{"count":1,"name":"really","title":"really"},{"count":1,"name":"read","title":"read"},{"count":1,"name":"good","title":"good"},{"count":1,"name":"but","title":"but"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1557320.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s1557320.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s1557320.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1557320.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1754013\/","id":"1754013","publisher":"HarperTorch","isbn10":"006101351X","isbn13":"9780061013515","title":"The Perfect Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1754013","alt_title":"完美风暴","author_intro":"","summary":"\n\nOctober 1991.

Wolfe was the recipient of a Fulbright fellowship in 1997 and was awarded the National Institutes of Health (NIH) International Research Scientist Development Award in 1999 and the prestigious NIH Director's Pioneer Award in 2005.","summary":"In The Viral Storm, award-winning biologist Nathan Wolfe tells the story of how viruses and human beings have evolved side by side through history; how deadly viruses like HIV, swine flu, and bird flu almost wiped us out in the past; and why modern life has made our species vulnerable to the threat of a global pandemic.Wolfe's research missions to the jungles of Africa and the rain forests of Borneo have earned him the nickname \"the Indiana Jones of virus hunters,\" and here Wolfe takes listeners along on his groundbreaking and often dangerous research trips-to reveal the surprising origins of the most deadly diseases and to explain the role that viruses have played in human evolution.In a world where each new outbreak seems worse than the one before, Wolfe points the way forward, as new technologies are brought to bear in the most remote areas of the world to neutralize these viruses and even harness their power for the good of humanity.

But is it the greatest archaeological find in history—or the most terrifying?\n \n\nFormer naval doctor Peter Crane is urgently summoned to a remote oil platform in the North Atlantic to help diagnose a bizarre medical condition spreading through the rig. But when he arrives, Crane learns that the real trouble lies far below—on “Deep Storm,” a stunningly advanced science research facility built two miles beneath the surface on the ocean floor. The topsecret structure has been designed for one purpose: to excavate a recently discovered undersea site that may hold the answers to a mystery steeped in centuries of myth and speculation. \n\nSworn to secrecy, Dr. Crane descends to Deep Storm. A year earlier, he is told, routine drilling uncovered the remains of mankind’s most sophisticated ancient civilization: the legendary Atlantis. But now that the site is being excavated, a series of disturbing illnesses has begun to affect the operation. Scientists and technicians are experiencing a bizarre array of symptoms—from simple fatigue to violent psychotic episodes. As Crane is indoctrinated into the strange world of Deep Storm and commences his investigation, he begins to suspect that the covert facility conceals something more complicated than a medical mystery.The discovery of Atlantis might, in fact, be a cover for something far more sinister . . . and deadly. \n\nLike Lincoln Child’s spectacular bestsellers coauthored with Douglas Preston ( The Book of the   Dead ,  Relic ),  Deep Storm  melds scientific detail and gripping adventure in a superbly imagined, chillingly real journey into unknown territory. Child is a master of suspense, and  Deep Storm  is his most ambitious novel to date.","price":"CDN$ 34.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Story of Real Madrid (Mainstream Sport)","author":["Phil Ball"],"pubdate":"2003-09-01","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"皇家马德里","title":"皇家马德里"},{"count":1,"name":"足球","title":"足球"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4182018.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"224","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4182018.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4182018.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4182018.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1851116\/","id":"1851116","publisher":"Mainstream Publishing","isbn10":"1840187638","isbn13":"9781840187632","title":"White Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1851116","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Within the trophy room at the Bernabeu, the spoils of a century's achievements provide indisputable evidence of football's conquistadores rubbing the world's noses in the dirt.

But once the first daring mariners successfully navigated to far shores—whether it was the Vikings, the Irish, the Chinese, Christopher Columbus in the north, or the Portuguese and the Spanish in the south—the Atlantic evolved in the world's growing consciousness of itself as an enclosed body of water bounded by the Americas to the West, and by Europe and Africa to the East. Atlantic is a biography of this immense space, of a sea which has defined and determined so much about the lives of the millions who live beside or near its tens of thousands of miles of coast.\n.\nThe Atlantic has been central to the ambitions of explorers, scientists and warriors, and it continues to affect our character, attitudes, and dreams. Poets to potentates, seers to sailors, fishermen to foresters—all have a relationship with this great body of blue-green sea and regard her as friend or foe, adversary or ally, depending on circumstance or fortune. Simon Winchester chronicles that relationship, making the Atlantic come vividly alive. Spanning from the earth's geological origins to the age of exploration, World War II battles to modern pollution, his narrative is epic and awe-inspiring.\n.\nThe definitive biography of the world's most important body of water -- the Atlantic. One hundred and ninety million years ago, the sh ifting of two of the world's tectonic plates led to the creation of an immense chasm. This giant gash in the flanks of the planet slowly opened up and eventually evolved into the most important and most travelled ocean in our world. In this utterly original biography, Simon Winchester explores the life of the Atlantic; it's birth, its relationship with mankind, and what lies in store for it once man has left the stage. He charts the development of the first settlements by the Oceanside -- the communities of Celts and Vikings and whose lives depended on the sea -- and delves into the age of exploration, venturing to forgotten worlds. The building of some of the world's most beautiful port cities -- London, Rio de Janeiro, New York, Casablanca -- is also examined, along with the creation of settlements and colonies in and around the sea. Completely unique and highly readable, Atlantic takes its reader on a wonderful journey through time, along the waves of our planet's most significant ocean.\n.\n【From Publishers Weekly】\n.\nWinchester, bestselling author of The Professor and the Madman, returns to the natural world with his epic new book, a \"biography\" of the Atlantic Ocean, from its origins 370 million years ago through the population of its shores by humanity and their interactions with it. He sees the Atlantic as the vital ingredient in the blooming of Western civilization. He scrutinizes the early explorations from the Vikings and Norsemen through Columbus, detailing the perils of the open sea. With his excellent research and engrossing anecdotes about the ocean as \"a living thing,\" Winchester spotlights its inspiration on poets, painters, and writers in its majestic beauty. Although he does not neglect the chief tragedies of the Atlantic, like the slave trade and the maritime battles, Winchester occasionally flits beelike from scene to scene, and the facts become lost in a blur. Maybe this is the price for such a monumental undertaking. Nevertheless, Winchester's sea saga is necessary reading for those who want to understand the planet better, even as, he notes, our waters are rapidly changing from pollution, overfishing, and climate change. 44 b&w illus.; 4 maps.

All rights reserved.\n.\n【From Booklist】\n.\nOf all of Winchester’s amazingly educational and entertaining books, a list that includes the best-selling The Map That Changed the World (2001) and Krakatoa (2003), his latest one is perhaps the most unique and the most creative in its approach. It is presented as a biography—of an ocean! It is as if he is telling the life story of the Atlantic, and, indeed, as we learn from one of the most wondrous facts presented here, oceans actually do have life spans—they have “their beginnings and their endings.” The Atlantic, as we are told, was born 10 million years ago by the continental split between Africa and South America, and its death will occur some 170 million years from now. The geological history of this vast body of water is partnered with the human story of habitation around it, and travel over it, because in Winchester’s view, the Atlantic has functioned as the “inland sea of Western civilization.” His coverage of aspects of human involvement with this ocean is lively and extensive, with topics ranging from the Atlantic as represented in the arts to the effects of climate change and overfishing and from immigration patterns to the use of the ocean’s waters for warfare. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Winchester’s latest is bound to follow his previous books onto best-seller lists, and this one should be promoted as one of his best.\n--Brad Hooper\n.\n【Review】\n.\n“Winchester brings a knowledge as vast and deep as his subject to this history of the Atlantic Ocean.”\n--Entertainment Weekly","ebook_price":"99.79","price":"USD 27.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Freely, John"],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"英文版","title":"英文版"},{"count":2,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":2,"name":"军事","title":"军事"},{"count":1,"name":"草原民族","title":"草原民族"},{"count":1,"name":"突厥","title":"突厥"},{"count":1,"name":"战争史","title":"战争史"},{"count":1,"name":"军事史","title":"军事史"},{"count":1,"name":"中世纪","title":"中世纪"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6833556.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"304","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6833556.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6833556.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6833556.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4678173\/","id":"4678173","publisher":"","isbn10":"1845117034","isbn13":"9781845117030","title":"Storm on Horseback-The Seljuk Warriors of Turkey","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4678173","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"325.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A New History of the Second World War","author":["Andrew Roberts"],"pubdate":"2010-5-25","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"歷史","title":"歷史"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4765575.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"792","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4765575.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4765575.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4765575.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5252897\/","id":"5252897","publisher":"Penguin UK","isbn10":"0141029285","isbn13":"9780141029283","title":"The Storm of War","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5252897","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Andrew Roberts is a biographer and historian of international renown whose books include Salisbury: Victorian Titan (winner, the Wolfson Prize for History); Masters and Commanders; and The Storm of War, which reached No. 2 on the Sunday Times bestseller list. His most recent book was Napoleon the Great (2014), which won the Grand Prix of the Fondation Napoléon. Roberts is a Fellow of the Royal Societies of Literature and Arts. He appears regularly on British television and radio and writes for the Sunday Telegraph, Spectator, Literary Review, Mail on Sunday and Daily Telegraph.","summary":"On 2 August 1944, Winston Churchill mocked Adolf Hitler in the House of Commons by the rank he had reached in the First World War. 'Russian success has been somewhat aided by the strategy of Herr Hitler, of Corporal Hitler', Churchill jibed. 'Even military idiots find it difficult not to see some faults in his actions'. Andrew Roberts' previous book \"Masters and Commanders\" studied the creation of Allied grand strategy; \"The Storm of War\" now analyzes how Axis strategy evolved. Examining the Second World War on every front, Roberts asks whether, with a different decision-making process and a different strategy, the Axis might even have won. Were those German generals who blamed everything on Hitler after the war correct, or were they merely scapegoating their former Fuhrer once he was safely beyond defending himself? The book is full of illuminating sidelights on the principle actors that bring their characters and the ways in which they reached decisions into fresh focus.","price":"USD 28.75"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Dirk Pitt Adventure","author":["Clive Cussler","Dirk Cussler"],"pubdate":"2014-10-28","tags":[],"origin_title":"Havana Storm","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29960862.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"464","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29960862.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29960862.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29960862.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26272184\/","id":"26272184","publisher":"G.P.

Meanwhile, Pitt’s children, marine engineer Dirk and oceanographer Summer, are on an investigation of their own, chasing an Aztec stone that may reveal the whereabouts of a vast historical Aztec treasure. The problem is, that stone was believed to have been destroyed on the battleship Maine in Havana Harbor in 1898, which brings them both to Cuba as well—and squarely into harm’s way. The three of them have been in desperate situations before . . . but perhaps never quite as dire as the one facing them now.","price":"GBP 22.91"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Critical Overview (Literary Criticism in Perspective)","author":["Wiebke Strehl"],"pubdate":"2000-06-24","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"文学","title":"文学"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1680535.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"257","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s1680535.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s1680535.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1680535.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1811757\/","id":"1811757","publisher":"Camden House","isbn10":"1571130454","isbn13":"9781571130457","title":"Theodor Storm's Immensee","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1811757","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Theodor Storm (1817-88), one of the leading literary Realists of the nineteenth century, achieved world-wide popularity with the novella Immensee\/ in 1849. The work, which Storm himself referred to as a 'Perle deutscher Poesie' (pearl of German poetry) reached over thirty editions and was translated into 17 languages by the time of the author's death. But in addition to being called a masterpiece by such leading literary lights of the day as Theodor Fontane and Paul Heyse, Immensee also attracted its share of criticism from the first, for instance as a mere sentimental love story. Then in the 1930s and forties Storm's novella was seized upon by right-wing critics as appropriate National Socialist reading material, which had the effect of sullying its reputation somewhat long after 1945. Since the 1960s Immensee's critical reputation has been rehabilitated and both novella and Storm himself analyzed from a variety of viewpoints, including Marxism and democratic humanitarianism. Strehl's book chronicles the highlights of this critical history.Wiebke Strehl is assistant professor of German at the University of South Carolina.","price":"USD 60.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Cressida Cowell"],"pubdate":"2010-4-15","tags":[{"count":4,"name":"DavidTennant","title":"DavidTennant"},{"count":3,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":2,"name":"有声书","title":"有声书"},{"count":2,"name":"儿童文学","title":"儿童文学"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"冒险","title":"冒险"},{"count":1,"name":"audiobook","title":"audiobook"},{"count":1,"name":"CressidaCowell","title":"CressidaCowell"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7660798.jpg","binding":"Audio CD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7660798.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7660798.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7660798.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10482003\/","id":"10482003","publisher":"Hodder Children's Books","isbn10":"1844569810","isbn13":"9781844569816","title":"How to Ride a Dragon's Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10482003","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 13.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":4,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Clancy, Tom"],"pubdate":"1998-2","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"英文小说","title":"英文小说"},{"count":1,"name":"技术惊悚","title":"技术惊悚"},{"count":1,"name":"小說","title":"小說"},{"count":1,"name":"sci-fi","title":"sci-fi"},{"count":1,"name":"TomClancy","title":"TomClancy"},{"count":1,"name":"Techno-thriller","title":"Techno-thriller"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4759360.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"832","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4759360.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4759360.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4759360.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6052706\/","id":"6052706","publisher":"","isbn10":"0006173624","isbn13":"9780006173625","title":"Red Storm Rising","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6052706","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Tom Clancy's second classic No 1 bestselling thriller -- a chillingly authentic vision of modern war -- now reissued in a new cover.

Jason Ā. Josephson-Storm argues that as broad cultural history goes, this narrative is wrong, as attempts to suppress magic have failed more often than they have succeeded. Even the human sciences have been more enchanted than is commonly supposed. But that raises the question: How did a magical, spiritualist, mesmerized Europe ever convince itself that it was disenchanted?\nJosephson-Storm traces the history of the myth of disenchantment in the births of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, folklore, psychoanalysis, and religious studies. Ironically, the myth of mythless modernity formed at the very time that Britain, France, and Germany were in the midst of occult and spiritualist revivals. Indeed, Josephson-Storm argues, these disciplines' founding figures were not only aware of, but profoundly enmeshed in, the occult milieu; and it was specifically in response to this burgeoning culture of spirits and magic that they produced notions of a disenchanted world.\nBy providing a novel history of the human sciences and their connection to esotericism, The Myth of Disenchantment dispatches with most widely held accounts of modernity and its break from the premodern past.","price":"USD 32.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Aftermath of Slavery","author":["Leon F.

How will Social Security and Medicare function with fewer working taxpayers to support these programs? According to Laurence Kotlikoff and Scott Burns, if our government continues on the course it has set, we'll see skyrocketing tax rates, drastically lower retirement and health benefits, high inflation, a rapidly depreciating dollar, unemployment, and political instability. The government has lost its compass, say Kotlikoff and Burns, and the Bush administration's spending and tax policies have charted a course straight into the coming generational storm.\n \n Kotlikoff and Burns take us on a guided tour of our generational imbalance: There's the \"fiscal child abuse\" that will double the taxes paid by the next generation. There's also the \"deficit delusion\" of the under-reported national debt. And none of this, they say, will be solved by any of the popularly touted remedies: cutting taxes, technological progress, immigration, foreign investment, or the elimination of wasteful government spending. Kotlikoff and Burns propose bold new policies, including meaningful reforms of Social Security and Medicare, that are simple, straightforward, and geared to attract support from both political parties.","price":"USD 18.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Jeff Soto"],"pubdate":"2008","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"致敬...","title":"致敬..."}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3362373.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3362373.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3362373.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3362373.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3297667\/","id":"3297667","publisher":"Mark Murphy Designs","isbn10":"0977143082","isbn13":"9780977143085","title":"Jeff Soto Storm Clouds","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3297667","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Martin, George R.R."],"pubdate":"2012-3","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"奇幻","title":"奇幻"},{"count":1,"name":"英语","title":"英语"},{"count":1,"name":"有声书","title":"有声书"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"冰与火之歌","title":"冰与火之歌"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7089897.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7089897.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7089897.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7089897.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10433294\/","id":"10433294","publisher":"","isbn10":"0449011909","isbn13":"9780449011904","title":"A Storm of Swords","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10433294","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"THE BOOK BEHIND THE THIRD SEASON OF GAME OF THRONES,AN ORIGINAL SERIES NOW ON HBO. \n \nHere is the third volume in George R.

Martin’s stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.\n\n A STORM OF SWORDS\n\n Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King’s Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. . . .\n\nBut as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others—a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. As the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords. . . .\n\n\n From the Trade Paperback edition.","price":"$ 101.70"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"德语经典文学手绘插图本","author":["Theodor Storm"],"pubdate":"2013-12","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"茵梦湖","title":"茵梦湖"},{"count":1,"name":"爱情","title":"爱情"},{"count":1,"name":"施托姆","title":"施托姆"},{"count":1,"name":"德国","title":"德国"},{"count":1,"name":"人性","title":"人性"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27288690.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":["励洁丹"],"catalog":"001 茵梦湖\n049 白马骑士\n213 汉斯熊","pages":"230","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s27288690.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s27288690.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s27288690.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/25892372\/","id":"25892372","publisher":"光明日报出版社","isbn10":"7511255434","isbn13":"9787511255433","title":"茵梦湖","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/25892372","alt_title":"","author_intro":"施托姆是德国19世纪中叶著名的小说家和抒情诗人，是德国“诗意的现实主义”的杰出代表，也是最早被译介到中国的欧洲作家之一。","summary":"该书属于“德语经典文学手绘插画本”系列丛书中的其中一本；施托姆(Theodor Storm, 1817-1888）是德国19世纪中叶著名的小说家和抒情诗人，是德国“诗意的现实主义”的杰出代表，也是最早被译介到中国的欧洲作家之一，其主要成就在中短篇小说方面，尤其是轰动文坛、令人哀婉潸然的《茵梦湖》、淳朴简单的童话《汉斯熊》、绝笔之作《骑白马的人》等，文字间流露的现实主义中的诗意浪漫使其作品成了永恒的经典。","series":{"id":"26169","title":"德语经典文学手绘插画本"},"price":"39.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":10,"average":"9.5","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Benji Davies"],"pubdate":"2016-9-22","tags":[{"count":7,"name":"绘本","title":"绘本"},{"count":1,"name":"艺术","title":"艺术"},{"count":1,"name":"插画","title":"插画"},{"count":1,"name":"儿童","title":"儿童"},{"count":1,"name":"forkids","title":"forkids"},{"count":1,"name":"2019年","title":"2019年"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29053612.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"32","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29053612.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29053612.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29053612.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/24810103\/","id":"24810103","publisher":"SIMON & SCHUSTER","isbn10":"1471119971","isbn13":"9781471119972","title":"The Storm Whale in Winter","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/24810103","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"A follow-up to the best-selling The Storm Whale, winner of the 2014 inaugural Oscar's First Book Prize in association with the Evening Standard.It's winter time and Noi's island is covered in a blanket of snow.

His body of theoretical work focuses on buildings of crisis, whether marred by major earthquakes, suffering the effects of economic embargo, or damaged by war. Since the destruction of the World Trade Center, his designs have taken on new meaning and significance. In \"The Storm and the Fall,\" Woods brings his visions to a new depth, moving them from feverishly rendered drawings to three-dimensional space. The book focuses on two recent Woods installations - one at the Houghton Gallery at New York's Cooper Union, the other at the Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain, Paris - that address the role of today's architecture. The Storm critiques the geometric box that rules most building designs and proposes instead a dynamic field of potential energy, represented by a complex array of vectors. The Fall crystallizes a built space in the midst of collapse, witnessing a moment too brief to inhabit - except in imagination. Both pieces are explored in Woods's powerful sketches, renderings, models, and constructions, exposing the mutations that enable them to be. A postscript of his hopeful design for a new World Center relates even more of his ideas, and essays by Anthony Vidler and Paul Virilio offer insights into the significance of the work.","price":"USD 50.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Theodor Storm"],"pubdate":"2003-4-15","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"德国","title":"德国"},{"count":1,"name":"特奥多·施托姆","title":"特奥多·施托姆"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"外国文学","title":"外国文学"},{"count":1,"name":"TheodorStorm","title":"TheodorStorm"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6565389.jpg","binding":"Taschenbuch","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"160","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6565389.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6565389.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6565389.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6558306\/","id":"6558306","publisher":"Fischer (Tb.), Frankfurt","isbn10":"3596159822","isbn13":"9783596159826","title":"Der Schimmelreiter","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6558306","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"EUR 6.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Truth About the Coming Climate Catastrophe and Our Last Chance to Save Humanity","author":["James Hansen (Author)"],"pubdate":"2010-12","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"society","title":"society"},{"count":2,"name":"Politics","title":"Politics"},{"count":2,"name":"Climate","title":"Climate"},{"count":1,"name":"气候","title":"气候"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6448642.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"319","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6448642.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6448642.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6448642.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6505010\/","id":"6505010","publisher":"Bloomsbury USA","isbn10":"1608195023","isbn13":"9781608195022","title":"Storms of My Grandchildren","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6505010","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"An urgent and provocative call to action from the world's leading climate scientist, who reveals for the first time what we need to know about humanity's last chance to get off the path to a catastrophic global meltdown and why we don't know the half of it.","price":"$ 18.08"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":4,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Grotenstein, Jonathan;

Gnawing it over later, it seems to them there is only one thing they can do: Find out who she is, and eliminate the only possible witness...","price":"$ 9.03"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Pathway Through Post-Rock","author":["Jack Chuter"],"pubdate":"2015-11-15","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28398044.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"295","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28398044.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28398044.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28398044.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26722512\/","id":"26722512","publisher":"Function Books","isbn10":"0957249225","isbn13":"9780957249226","title":"Storm Static Sleep","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/26722512","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Shilpi Saxena"],"pubdate":"2015-3-27","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"计算机","title":"计算机"},{"count":1,"name":"英文版","title":"英文版"},{"count":1,"name":"数据库","title":"数据库"},{"count":1,"name":"数据平台","title":"数据平台"},{"count":1,"name":"Cassandra","title":"Cassandra"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28237465.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"220","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28237465.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28237465.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28237465.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26359182\/","id":"26359182","publisher":"Packt Publishing","isbn10":"1784395498","isbn13":"9781784395490","title":"Real-time Analytics with Storm and Cassandra","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/26359182","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 44.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Roger Dean","Storm Thorgerson"],"pubdate":"2008-11-01","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4037045.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"160","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4037045.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4037045.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4037045.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4114697\/","id":"4114697","publisher":"Collins Design","isbn10":"0061626953","isbn13":"9780061626951","title":"Album Cover Album","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4114697","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"A stunningly designed review of the greatest album cover designs, spanning the classic period from the 1950s to the 1970s,  Album Cover Album  first hit the bestseller charts in 1977. This led to the release of six follow-up hits, inspired a host of imitations, and generated a long-playing sub-genre in art and design publishing.    Album Cover Album  is edited and compiled by two designers who were among the most innovative pioneers of the work that it celebrates. Storm Thorgerson's Hipgnosis earned world renown for the epic photo shoots and iconic designs that went so perfectly with the music of Pink Floyd. Meanwhile, Roger Dean's dreamscapes and unique typography became as much a part of the rock generation as the Yes albums they adorned.  Album Cover Album  features their selection of more than 600 sleeves in full color, and showcases the astonishing diversity and excellence of design that the medium produced in its first three decades.   This new edition retains the lavish 12-inch format of the original and replays the ingeniously themed compositions of each page. The album is given a fresh spin by a new preface from Peter Gabriel and new forewords by Storm Thorgerson and John Wetton, plus a 21  st  -century typographic facelift. The result is a celebration of the enduring appeal of vinyl.","price":"USD 29.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"How I Found My Heart in the Middle of the Ocean","author":["Tori Murden Mcclure"],"pubdate":"2009-4-1","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"传记","title":"传记"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4234900.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/28297090\/","pages":"304","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4234900.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4234900.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4234900.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4695234\/","id":"4695234","publisher":"Harper","isbn10":"0061718866","isbn13":"9780061718861","title":"A Pearl in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4695234","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"\"In the end,\" writes Tori McClure, \"I know I rowed across the Atlantic to find my heart, but in the beginning, I wasn't aware that it was missing.\"       During June 1998, Tori McClure set out to row across the Atlantic Ocean by herself in a twenty-three-foot plywood boat with no motor or sail. Within days she lost all communication with shore, but nevertheless she decided to keep going. Not only did she lose the sound of a friendly voice, she lost updates on the location of the Gulf Stream and on the weather. Unfortunately for Tori, 1998 is still on record as the worst hurricane season in the North Atlantic. In deep solitude and perilous conditions, she was nonetheless determined to prove what one person with a mission can do. When she was finally brought to her knees by a series of violent storms that nearly killed her, she had to signal for help and go home in what felt like complete disgrace.     Back in Kentucky, however, Tori's life began to change in unexpected ways. She fell in love. At the age of thirty-five, she embarked on a serious relationship for the first time, making her feel even more vulnerable than sitting alone in a tiny boat in the middle of the Atlantic. She went to work for Muhammad Ali, who told her that she did not want to be known as the woman who \"almost\" rowed across the Atlantic Ocean. And she knew that he was right.     In this thrilling story of high adventure and romantic quest, Tori McClure discovers through her favorite way—the hard way—that the most important thing in life is not to prove you are superhuman but to fully to embrace your own humanity. With a wry sense of humor and a strong voice, she gives us a true memoir of an explorer who maps her world with rare emotional honesty.","ebook_price":"99.79","price":"USD 25.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Shooting Script","author":["James Schamus"],"pubdate":"1997","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"李安","title":"李安"},{"count":2,"name":"screenplay","title":"screenplay"},{"count":2,"name":"James_Schamus","title":"James_Schamus"},{"count":2,"name":"JamesSchamus","title":"JamesSchamus"},{"count":1,"name":"剧本","title":"剧本"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3948173.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3948173.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3948173.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3948173.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3992073\/","id":"3992073","publisher":"Newmarket Press","isbn10":"1854593226","isbn13":"9781854593221","title":"The Ice Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3992073","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["村崎 翠","D3パブリッシャー"],"pubdate":"2012-9-22","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"漫画","title":"漫画"},{"count":1,"name":"日本","title":"日本"},{"count":1,"name":"少女漫画","title":"少女漫画"},{"count":1,"name":"少女","title":"少女"},{"count":1,"name":"❤少女漫乙女心❤","title":"❤少女漫乙女心❤"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s22711326.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s22711326.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s22711326.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s22711326.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/19970128\/","id":"19970128","publisher":"アスキー・メディアワークス","isbn10":"4048910310","isbn13":"9784048910316","title":"STORM LOVER夏恋!!

Habeck traces the strategies developed between the wars for the use of armored vehicles in battle. Only in Germany and the Soviet Union were truly original armor doctrines (generally known as \"blitzkreig\" and \"deep battle\") fully implemented. Storm of Steel relates how the German and Soviet armies formulated and chose to put into practice doctrines that were innovative for the time, yet in many respects identical to one another.\nAs part of her extensive archival research in Russia, Germany, and Britain, Habeck had access to a large number of formerly secret and top-secret documents from several post-Soviet archives. This research informs her comparative approach as she looks at the roles of technology, shared influences, and assumptions about war in the formation of doctrine. She also explores relations between the Germans and the Soviets to determine whether collaboration influenced the convergence of their armor doctrines.","series":{"id":"7880","title":"Cornell Studies in Security Affairs"},"price":"USD 42.50"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A True Story of Men Against the Sea","author":["Sebastian Junger"],"pubdate":"2005-1-1","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29875545.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"112","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29875545.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29875545.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29875545.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1997762\/","id":"1997762","publisher":"Macmillan Education","isbn10":"1405073128","isbn13":"9781405073127","title":"The Perfect Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1997762","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 6.10"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History","author":["Larson, Erik\/ Cline, Isaac Monroe"],"pubdate":"2000","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"ErikLarson","title":"ErikLarson"},{"count":1,"name":"2012","title":"2012"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7058131.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"323","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7058131.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7058131.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7058131.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4498668\/","id":"4498668","publisher":"Vintage Books","isbn10":"143956468X","isbn13":"9781439564684","title":"Isaac's Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4498668","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"23.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":14,"average":"7.3","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["[美] 克里斯蒂·高登"],"pubdate":"2019-7-16","tags":[{"count":6,"name":"魔兽","title":"魔兽"},{"count":5,"name":"奇幻","title":"奇幻"},{"count":4,"name":"暴雪","title":"暴雪"},{"count":3,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"2019","title":"2019"}],"origin_title":"World of Warcraft: Before the Storm","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33312930.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":["李镭"],"catalog":"","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/126030062\/","pages":"368","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s33312930.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s33312930.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33312930.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30377825\/","id":"30377825","publisher":"北京时代华文书局","isbn10":"756992780X","isbn13":"9787569927801","title":"魔兽世界：风暴前夕","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30377825","alt_title":"World of Warcraft: Before the Storm","author_intro":"克里斯蒂˙高登，“魔兽世界”系列小说的传奇作者，《纽约时报》热销书榜的常客，著名科幻女作家，创作力超级旺盛，已出版了四十多部长篇小说，作品横跨科幻、奇幻及恐怖等多个类型。除了“魔兽世界”系列作品外，她还创作了“星际迷航”系列小说。\n高登是“魔兽世界”游戏的死忠粉，曾经创作了多部大卖的魔兽系小说，在国内都有出版。这本《魔兽世界：风暴前夕》是她在半引退般沉寂了很久后重新出山，创作的全新作品。","summary":"# 魔兽世界WOW全新故事，长篇小说！高度配合全新资料片“争霸艾泽拉斯”！\n# 克里斯蒂·高登重新出山之作，暴雪娱乐官方授权，年度巨献！\n# 都说Blizzard要凉凉，这回实力打脸！全球霸道网游“魔兽世界”永远不凉！\n* 全球超级网游“魔兽世界”新老玩家、粉丝必备，承接全新版本与老版本游戏的官方授权小说！新玩家找激情，老玩家找情怀！\n* 超过1500万玩家同时在线，影响全世界几亿人的霸道网游“魔兽世界”推出全新资料片“争霸艾泽拉斯”后的首本长篇小说！\n* “魔兽世界”大神级作家克里斯蒂•高登隐退多年后重新出山，倾情创作出这部属于新魔兽时代的小说，讲述7.0版本后的情节发展，以及交待8.0版本的全新故事，延续之前创造的热卖奇迹！\n* “魔兽世界”系列小说创造过全球销量突破800万册的销售奇迹，现在奇迹延续！\n艾泽拉斯正在面临毁灭。部落和联盟击联手败了燃烧军团，不过一场可怕的灾难正在爆发。艾泽拉斯的心脏被堕落的泰坦萨格拉斯用宝剑刺出了一个致命的伤口。\n对暴风城的国王和部落首领、被遗忘者西尔瓦纳斯女王来说，几乎没有时间重建，更没有时间去哀悼。艾泽拉斯的毁灭性创伤揭示了一种神秘的物质——艾泽里特。在正义的人手中，这种神奇的黄金物质能够创造出令人难以置信的壮举；在邪恶的人手中，它可能带来不可想象的毁灭。\n随着联盟和部落的力量竞相揭开艾泽里特的秘密并治愈受伤的世界。国王制定了一个绝望计划，目的是在联盟和部落之间建立永久的和平。艾泽里特破坏了力量的平衡，所以国王必须得到希尔瓦纳斯的信任。但是，和以往一样，黑暗女王也有她自己的阴谋诡计。\n为了使和平成为可能，必须结束几代人的流血冲突和仇恨。但也有一些事实表明，联盟和部落双方都不愿意接受，谁都不愿放弃野心。就像联盟和部落都紧紧抓住艾泽里特的力量一样，他们之间一触即发的冲突很有可能演变成一场全面战争，一场给艾泽拉斯带来毁灭的战争。","ebook_price":"28.00","price":"56.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["P.

Floods.\n Climate refugees.\n Global warming isn't just about polar bears anymore.       Let's assume we do nothing about climate change. Imagine that we just continue to emit carbon at our current levels or even exceed those levels. How would our weather change? What would our forecast be? Welcome to  The Weather of the Future .     In this groundbreaking work, Dr. Heidi Cullen, one of the world's foremost climatologists and environmental journalists, puts a vivid face on climate change, offering a new way of seeing this phenomenon not just as an event set to happen in the distant future but as something happening right now in our own backyards. Arguing that we must connect the weather of today with the climate change of tomorrow, Cullen combines the latest research from scientists on the ground with state-of-the-art climate-model projections to create climate-change scenarios for seven of the most at-risk locations around the world.     From the Central Valley of California, where coming droughts will jeopardize the entire state's water supply, to Greenland, where warmer temperatures will give access to mineral wealth buried beneath ice sheets for millennia, Cullen illustrates how, if left unabated, climate change will transform every corner of the world by midcentury. What emerges is a mosaic of changing weather patterns that collectively spell out the range of risks posed by global warming—whether it's New York City, whose infrastructure is extremely vulnerable to even a relatively weak category 3 hurricane, or Bangladesh, a country so low-lying that millions of people could become climate refugees due to rising sea levels.     Provocative and convincing,  The Weather of the Future  makes climate change local, showing how no two regions of the country or the world will be affected in quite the same way, and demonstrating that melting ice is just the beginning.","ebook_price":"93.16","price":"USD 25.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Gould, Stephen Jay"],"pubdate":"1988-10","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"Evolution","title":"Evolution"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7085089.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"256","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7085089.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7085089.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7085089.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6357187\/","id":"6357187","publisher":"","isbn10":"0393305376","isbn13":"9780393305371","title":"Urchin in the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6357187","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Ranging as far as the fox and as deep as the hedgehog (the urchin of his title), Stephen Jay Gould expands on geology, biological determinism, \"cardboard Darwinism,\" and evolutionary theory in this sparkling collection.","price":"101.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":4,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm, Theodore W."],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"德语文学","title":"德语文学"},{"count":1,"name":"Poetry","title":"Poetry"},{"count":1,"name":"Germany","title":"Germany"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8717708.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"82","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8717708.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8717708.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8717708.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7907376\/","id":"7907376","publisher":"","isbn10":"1463899432","isbn13":"9781463899431","title":"Immensee","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7907376","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 21.41"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"2013-3-27","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"—原画集と公式书と资料设定集—","title":"—原画集と公式书と资料设定集—"},{"count":1,"name":"菊家","title":"菊家"},{"count":1,"name":"畫集","title":"畫集"},{"count":1,"name":"画集","title":"画集"},{"count":1,"name":"已入荷","title":"已入荷"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26012704.jpg","binding":"大型本","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"127","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26012704.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26012704.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26012704.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/22889918\/","id":"22889918","publisher":"エンターブレイン","isbn10":"4047288764","isbn13":"9784047288768","title":"STORM LOVER スチルセレクション バカップルカスタム!!

And mankind is not ready.\n\nThe final volume of the Wheel of Time,  A Memory of Light,  was partially written by Robert Jordan before his untimely passing in 2007. Brandon Sanderson,  New York Times  bestselling author of the Mistborn books, was chosen by Jordan’s editor--his wife, Harriet McDougal--to complete the final book. The scope and size of the volume was such that it could not be contained in a single book, and so Tor proudly presents  The Gathering Storm  as the first of three novels that will cover the outline left by Robert Jordan, chronicling Tarmon Gai'don and Rand al'Thor's final confrontatino with the Dark One. This short sequence will complete the struggle against the Shadow, bringing to a close a journey begun almost twenty years ago and marking the conclusion of the Wheel of Time, the preeminent fantasy epic of our era.\n\nIn this epic novel, Robert Jordan’s international bestselling series begins its dramatic conclusion. Rand al’Thor, the Dragon Reborn, struggles to unite a fractured network of kingdoms and alliances in preparation for the Last Battle. As he attempts to halt the Seanchan encroachment northward--wishing he could form at least a temporary truce with the invaders--his allies watch in terror the shadow that seems to be growing within the heart of the Dragon Reborn himself.\n\nEgwene al’Vere, the Amyrlin Seat of the rebel Aes Sedai, is a captive of the White Tower and subject to the whims of their tyrannical leader. As days tick toward the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent, Egwene works to hold together the disparate factions of Aes Sedai while providing leadership in the face of increasing uncertainty and despair. Her fight will prove the mettle of the Aes Sedai, and her conflict will decide the future of the White Tower--and possibly the world itself.\n\nThe Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow.","price":"USD 9.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Turbulent History Of Weather Prediction From Franklin'S Kite To El Ninosupplement1 Brown Pyrimidines","author":["Cox, John D."],"pubdate":"2002-8","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":1,"name":"科普","title":"科普"},{"count":1,"name":"我想读这本书","title":"我想读这本书"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8012530.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"252","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8012530.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8012530.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8012530.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4624935\/","id":"4624935","publisher":"","isbn10":"047138108X","isbn13":"9780471381082","title":"The Storm Watchers","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4624935","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"A lively, inspiring account of the pioneers who sought to accurately predict the weather  Benjamin Franklin ...James P.

Where they saw patterns and processes, others saw randomness and tumult-and yet they strove to make their voices heard, often saving lives in the process.  Storm Watchers takes you on a fascinating journey through time that captures the evolution of weather forecasting. From the age when meteorology was considered one step removed from sorcery to the modern-day wizardry of supercomputers, John Cox introduces you to the pioneering scientists whose work fulfilled an ancient dream and made it possible to foretell the future. He tells the little-known stories of these weathermen, such as Ptolemy's weather predictions based on astrology, John Finley's breakthrough research in identifying tornadoes, and Tor Bergeron's new techniques of weather forecasting, which contributed to its final worldwide acceptance. Filled with extraordinary tales of bravery and sacrifice, Storm Watchers will make you think twice the next time you turn on the local news to catch the weather report.","price":"238.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Salem Trials and the American Experience","author":["Emerson W.

They examine the prewar media debate, news coverage during and after the war, how the news-gathering process shaped the content of the coverage and the media's effect on public opinion and decision-makers. \"Taken by Storm\" also examines more general patterns in post-Cold War journalism and foreign policy, particularly how contemporary journalistic practices determine whose voices and what views are heard in foreign policy coverage.","price":"GBP 21.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":16,"average":"8.5","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["[美]约翰•奥斯特兰德 著","[阿根廷]奥马尔•弗朗西亚 绘"],"pubdate":"2018-10","tags":[{"count":5,"name":"漫画","title":"漫画"},{"count":5,"name":"星球大战","title":"星球大战"},{"count":3,"name":"美漫","title":"美漫"},{"count":1,"name":"星战传说","title":"星战传说"},{"count":1,"name":"已购","title":"已购"}],"origin_title":"Star Wars: Legacy, Vol. 7: Storms","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29924100.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":["张氚","虞佳炜"],"catalog":"","pages":"128","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29924100.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29924100.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29924100.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30285054\/","id":"30285054","publisher":"世界图书出版公司","isbn10":"7519248550","isbn13":"9787519248550","title":"星球大战：传承7","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30285054","alt_title":"Star Wars: Legacy, Vol. 7: Storms","author_intro":"约翰•奥斯特兰德（John Ostrander）\n奥斯特兰德是知名漫画编剧，他曾为DC漫画和漫威漫画等多家出版社工作，参与的作品包括《正义联盟》《X战警》《快银》和《惩罚者》。2000年，奥斯特兰德为黑马漫画创作的第一部《星球大战》漫画出版。在接下来的几年里，他参与创作了《星球大战：共和国》《星球大战：传承》等多部作品。2012年，奥斯特兰德与简•杜尔塞马推出了读者期待已久的《星球大战：绝地的黎明》。\n奥马尔•弗朗西亚（Omar Francia）\n弗朗西亚是阿根廷画师，他的代表作是《星球大战：传承》和《质量效应：救赎》。","summary":"戴符者事件的一场大战过后，黑暗尊主达斯•克雷特的死并没有如凯德所想的瓦解一人西斯。韦尔洛克向整个银河系隐瞒了克雷特的死讯，一人西斯将会永存……\n韦尔洛克继承了克雷特的遗志，下令全面追捕蒙卡拉马里人。他们当中的许多人，包括大多数领袖，早已惨遭毒手，或被投入集中营，被西斯帝国奴役至死。胜利的旗帜已经倒向西斯，此时的银河同盟希望能与费尔帝国的势力结盟，联手对抗他们的共同敌人。\n另一方面，凯德等人将重伤垂死的阿兹琳带给德鲁进行医治，但阿兹琳已经接受了原力的意愿，接受了自己的死亡，她不想再活下去了……\n本卷收录《星球大战：传承》的第32～36期。\n◎编辑推荐：\n史上销量首位的《星球大战》漫画。\n在黑马漫画公司出版的所有漫画中，位列历史畅销榜第二。","series":{"id":"28555","title":"世图动漫·星球大战系列"},"price":"45.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm Constantine"],"pubdate":"1998-06","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"SF\/F","title":"SF\/F"},{"count":1,"name":"LGBT","title":"LGBT"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4290472.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4290472.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4290472.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4290472.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2024376\/","id":"2024376","publisher":"Meisha Merlin Publishing, Inc.","isbn10":"0965834549","isbn13":"9780965834544","title":"Stalking Tender Prey (Constantine, Storm.

His award winning series The History of Rome chronologically narrated the entire history of the Roman Empire over 189 weekly episodes. Running from 2007-2012, The History of Rome has generated more than 56 million downloads and remains one of the most popular history podcasts on the internet. Duncan has continued this success with his ongoing series Revolutions--which so far has explored the English, American, French, and Haitian Revolutions. Since debuting in September 2013, Revolutions has generated more than 12 million downloads. Thanks to the worldwide popularity of his podcasts, Duncan has led fans on a number of sold-out guided tours of Italy, England, and France to visit historic sites from Ancient Rome to the French Revolution. Duncan also collaborates with illustrator Jason Novak on informative cartoons that humorously explain the historical context for current events. Their work has been featured in the New Yorker, Paris Review, Awl, and Morning News.","summary":"The creator of the massively popular, award-winning podcast series The History of Rome brings to life the story of the tumultuous years that set the stage for the fall of the Roman Republic.\nThe Roman Republic was one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of civilization. After its founding in 509 BCE, the Romans refused to allow a single leader to seize control of the state and grab absolute power. The Roman commitment to cooperative government and peaceful transfers of power was unmatched in the history of the ancient world.\nBut by the year 133 BCE, the republican system was unable to cope with the vast empire Rome now ruled. Almost as soon as they had conquered the Mediterranean, Rome became engulfed in violent political conflicts and civil wars that would destroy the Republic less than a century later.\nChronicling the years 133-80 BCE, The Storm Before the Storm is a rollicking deep-dive into the bloody battles, political machinations, and human drama that defined a dangerous new political environment--a stark warning for modern readers about what happens to a civilization driven by increasing economic inequality, political polarization, and ruthless ambition.","price":"USD 27.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Brassey, Lady Annie"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21026199.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"544","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s21026199.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s21026199.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21026199.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/17643991\/","id":"17643991","publisher":"","isbn10":"1593333048","isbn13":"9781593333041","title":"Sunshine and Storm in the East, or Cruises to Cyprus and Consunshine and Storm in the East, or Cruises to Cyprus and Consunshine and Storm in the East","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/17643991","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""}]}

Their campaign of sea and shore, emboldened by a revolutionary technology, brought wealth, honor, and power to their confederacy while alienating colonial neighbors and thwarting English and French imperialism. Afloat, Indian hunter-warriors commanded fleets of sailing ships and coordinated punitive and plundering assaults on the heart of England's Atlantic economy. Ashore, Indian diplomats engaged in shrewd transatlantic negotiations with imperial officials of French Acadia and New England. Wabanaki communities had long looked to the sea for opportunities. By the Atlantic's Age of Sail, the People of the Dawn were mobilizing it to achieve a Native dominion governed by its sovereign masters and enriched by its profitable and compliant tributaries.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["This Contentious Storm: An Ecocritical and Performance History of King Lear (Environmental Cultures)"],"pubdate":"2017-8","tags":[],"origin_title":"This Contentious Storm: An Ecocritical and Performance History of King Lear (Environmental Cultures)","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s30004284.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"227","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s30004284.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s30004284.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s30004284.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30459432\/","id":"30459432","publisher":"Bloomsbury USA Academic","isbn10":"1474289045","isbn13":"9781474289047","title":"This Contentious Storm: An Ecocritical and Performance History of King Lear (Environmental Cultures)","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30459432","alt_title":"This Contentious Storm: An Ecocritical and Performance History of King Lear (Environmental Cultures)","author_intro":"Jennifer Mae Hamilton is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Gender and Cultural Studies at the University of Sydney, funded by The Seed Box: A MISTRA+FORMAS Environmental Humanities Collaboratory, Linköping University, Sweden.

英尺的地方，更像是些隐隐绰绰的轮廓、黑影。每当我朝他们移动时，他们就会退到雾中，当我试图接近他们想辨认他们时，他们更是快速地退进雾的深处。于是我亦步亦趋，进入雾中也越来越深。\n这些怪异的生命体不停地催促我，要跟紧他们。\n我再三地问它们，我们要到哪里去？他们回答说：“快点！你会知道的。”随后，他们不再回答，只是不断地要我快快地跟着他们。\n他们还不断地告诉我，我的疼痛是毫无意义的，也是不必要的：“疼痛是胡扯的。”\n我知道我们已经走了几英里，偶尔地，我有种奇异的能力能回头看到医院的病房，我的身体仍旧静静地躺在病床上。每次看的时候，就好像是我漂浮在病房的上面朝下看一样，但似乎又有数百万英里的距离。我看到了我的妻子和病友仍在病房里，我想他们还不能帮助我，决定继续跟着这些人走。\n走了相当长的一段距离，这些生命体都围绕着我。他们带我穿行在薄雾中，我不知道究竟有多长时间，只觉得有一种真实的永恒感。从某种意义上讲我无法知道有多长时间，但感到是很长一段时间，可能是几天或几周了。\n随着我们渐行渐远，雾也越来越厚、越来越黑，这些人开始变了。起先，他们好像是快乐而顽皮，但当我们走了一段路后，一些人开始变得有敌意。我的问题越多，怀疑越大，他们愈是有敌意，粗暴专横。他们开始取笑我的赤裸的臀部，因我的病号服不能遮体；他们还嘲弄我是如何的可怜。我知道他们在谈论我，但当我想搞清楚他们究竟在说什么时，他们当中有人就会说：“嘘——，他会听到的，他会听到。”\n于是，其它的一些人像是警告那些攻击我的同伴，我听到他们似乎在警告那些攻击我的人要小心点，免得把我吓跑了。\n我对这一切感到好奇怪，继续发问，他们再三地催我赶快走，并要我住嘴。我心里忐忑不安，加上他们不断地骚扰我，我决定返回，但此时我已经不知道往哪里走了，我迷路了。没有任何参照物，有的只是雾和湿漉漉、凉乎乎的地面，我无法定位，失去了方向感。\n所有我跟他们之间的交流都停留在口头上，就像人类之间的交流一样。他们看来不知道我在想什么，我也不知道他们在想什么。但越来越明显，他们是骗子，我跟他们耗的时间越长，想要的帮助就越遥远。\n数小时前，我还希望死亡会终结我的痛苦不堪的生命，不料现在事情更糟，我被这群充满敌意而又残暴的家伙们挟持着，朝着黑暗中莫测的目的地而行。他们开始对我喊叫，恶狠狠地侮辱我，苛求我要尽快跟上，并不再回答我的问题。\n最后，我告诉他们我不再走一步了。这时，他们完全变了。他们变得更加有敌意，气势汹汹地要我跟他们走。一些人开始推搡我，而我则还击他们。\n随之而来的是疯狂的辱骂、尖叫和殴打，而我也像个野人一样同他们打斗。这期间，显而易见的是，他们一直玩得很开心。\n看起来对他们而言，这差不多像是一场游戏，而我是他们的玩物，我的痛苦就是他们的欢乐。他们想让我受伤，抓我、咬我。每当我赶走了一个，立刻就会有五个或更多的涌上来。\n此时，天气几乎完全黑了。我觉得他们不像是只有二十或三十个，而是数不胜数。他们源源不断地来参加伤害我的盛会，我的抵抗只会招到更多的戏弄。他们开始用最无耻的方式在肉体上羞辱我。当我继续与他们搏斗时，我意识到他们不急于取胜，而是像猫捉老鼠一样地玩弄我。每一轮新的攻击都伴随着刺耳的嚎叫。有时，他们撕破并扯下我身上的皮肉，我惊恐地意识到我要被他们慢慢地扯成碎片、生吞活剥了，这样，他们的娱乐就会尽可能的延长。\n我从来也不曾遇到过像这样无以复加、连人类也做不到的欺哄和攻击。贴切地说，他们是你所能想象得出的最坏的且没有一丁点好意的人。他们当中的一些人看上去能告诉其它人怎么做，但我感觉不到任何组织结构或阶层，他们似乎不像是受谁控制或领导。从根本上讲，他们就是一群被放肆而残暴的激情驱使的暴徒。\n在我们打斗时，我注意到他们似乎没有疼痛，但也没有什么特别的人类所没有的能力或超人类的能力。\n虽然在开始时，我以为他们穿了衣服，但在随后的肢体接触中，我没有感觉到任何类似衣服的东西。\n恶斗了好长一段时间，我最终精疲力竭、疲惫不堪地躺倒在他们中间，他们渐渐地安静下来，因为我不再是他们的玩物了，这使得他们当中的大多数人失望，但还有少数人仍然在挑逗、骚扰我，奚落我了然无趣。此时此刻，我已经饱受摧残，虽然他们还在不时地挑衅，我只能躺在那里像堆碎片，无力反抗了。\n究竟是怎样发生的……我不准备试着在这里解释，我只是觉得在我里面有一个声音，我自己的声音，说：“向上帝祈祷。”\n我的脑子里回答说：“我不祈祷。我不知道怎样祈祷。”\n我看到在黑暗中有一个人躺在地上，如果没有几百个也一定有数十个邪恶的生命体在撕扯他。这情形看上去是绝对没有希望了，不管我是否相信上帝，我都没有指望了。\n那个声音再次告诉我要向上帝祈祷。我犹豫不决，不知道该怎样做。第三次，那个声音告诉我要向上帝祈祷。\n我开始说一些诸如：“耶和华是我的牧者，我必不至缺乏……上帝保佑美国。”之类的好像是宗教上的用语。\n就像是向那些家伙们泼了一盆滚烫的油，他们全都狂暴不止，不住地朝我大喊大叫，要我停下，因为没有上帝，没人能听到我的声音。但就在他们尖声喊叫、污言秽语时，全都朝后面退去──好像我是毒药。他们一边后退，一边像疯狗一样地尖叫、咒诅，说我是懦夫，我所说的毫无价值。\n我也朝他们高喊：“我们在天上的父……”等等。就这样，持续了一段时间，突然，我感到他们已经走了。天色黑暗，我独自在那里呼喊着一些听起来是教会的用语。这些用语对付这些可怕的生命体如此有效，我感到高兴。\n躺在那里有很长时间，我处在如此无助、绝望的黑暗中，没有办法知道究竟有多长时间了。我只是躺在无名之地──一切都是破碎而恍惚，我没有一点力气，一切都完了。就像是衰竭了，我的任何努力都将消耗最后的一点能量。我觉得自己正在枯萎，沉到黑暗中。\n被耶稣基督救出地狱\n现在，我甚至不知道我是否还在这个世界上，但我确定我在这里。我真实地存在着，所有的意识如此痛楚地清醒着。我不知道我是怎样到这里的，即便在体力能行走，也没有方向可循。我所能感觉得到的就是这一天所遭受的巨大苦楚是无与伦比，这就是我存在的绝对的终点，它比我曾经所能想象得到的任何东西都更可怕。\n这时，一件最不平凡的事发生了，我再一次地非常清晰地听到我自己的声音，是小时候在教会主日学学到的东西，是一首短歌：“耶稣爱我，我知道……”且不断地重复。不知道为什么，我忽然想相信它。什么也没留下，我想依靠这个念头。于是，我由衷地、用尽最后残存的一点气力和知觉喊叫着：“耶稣，请你救救我！”\n当我这样做的时候，我看到在黑暗中的某处，有一个很微小的星星，不知道它究竟是什么，我推测它一定是颗彗星或流星，因它在快速地移动，而且我发现它冲着我而来，迅速地越变越亮。\n当光靠近我的时候，它的光辉洒满在我的身上，我站起来了──不是我的努力，而是被提起来的。接着，我看见──非常真切地看见，我身上所有的伤口、眼泪、破裂逐渐消除，在光辉中我变得完好无损。\n我能做的就是不由自主地号淘大哭，不是因为我脱离了悲惨的境地，而是我感受到了今生前所未有的东西。\n另外一件事发生了，我一下子知道了大量的东西上，我知道……我知道这光和这光辉熟悉我。我不知道如何向你解释这一点，但当时我就明白了这点。事实上，我知道它比我的父母还要了解我。这个明亮的光体亲密地拥抱着我、理解我，并开始传授大量的有知识的意识。我知道他晓得我的一切，无条件地爱我、接纳我。\n这光传达给我信息：它以一种我还不能表达的方式爱我，我从来不知道爱还能这样。他是一个集中的能量场，发出的光彩难以言表，只能说是美善和爱，比任何人想象的更亲爱。\n我知道这光辉威力强大，它使我整个人感觉良好。我能感受到它的光照在我的身上，像非常轻柔的手环绕着我；我还能感到它扶持我，同时以无法抗拒的力量爱我。在饱受折磨之后，得到这光体完全的理解、接纳和热烈的爱──这爱超过了我的所知所想，我一边泪如泉涌，一边随着光体上升，离开那里。\n我们越来越快，脱离了黑暗。被光环绕着，我感到十分惬意，不停地哭泣。我远远地看到像是星系的图景，不同的是比我曾在地球上观看时更大，有更多的星星。\n有一个巨大的光明的中心，里面有一个非常明亮的集中点，外里有数不清的光球朝着里面的一个巨大的生命体飞进去或飞出来。它们很远。\n这时，我……我没有用嘴说，只是在意念里说：“把我放回去。”\n我的意思是告诉光把我放回到刚才的深渊中，因我对自己及自己一生所做的事深感羞愧，只想隐藏在黑暗中。我想不再朝着那大光前行了──想停但却没有停。在我的这一生中，不知有多少次我曾否认且嘲笑这位在我面前的真实存在；也不知有多少次我以它为诅咒。多么难以置信的理性上的傲慢，竟以它的名为侮辱。我害怕靠近它。我还想到，也许这些强烈得惊人的辐射会将我在感觉上还是完整无缺的身体分崩离析。\n[编按: 霍华德认为他的这位朋友是耶稣。]\n扶持我的这个生命体，我的朋友，意识到了我的畏惧、勉强和羞愧。第一次，他以一个男性的声音在我的思想中告诉我，如果我不舒服，我们就不去靠近。所以我们停下，距离那个伟大的生命体仍无数英里远。\n也是第一次，我的朋友，下文中我要用“他”相称，对我说：“你属于这里。”\n面对这些光辉，我强烈地感到自己的卑贱，我回答到：“不，你搞错了，把我放回去。”\n他说：“我们不会错。你属于。”\n随后，他用一种悦耳的音调呼唤那些环绕着巨大中心的发光体。有几个发光体来到我们跟前，围绕着我们。在接下来的时间里，他们有些来、有些去，但通常有五到六个、有时甚至有八个和我们在一起。\n我还在哭。他们来的第一件事都是关切地询问我：“你害怕我们吗？”\n我告诉他们我不怕。\n他们说，他们可以把他们的辉光减弱点，这样会显得像人。我告知他们保持原样好了。他们是最美、最……\n说点题外话，我是艺术教授，知道在可见光谱中有三原色、三次色和六种三级色。但在这里，我看见的可见光谱至少有80种新的原色，还有这些光辉，我想去描述它，但遗憾的是办不到──这些色彩是我从未见过的。\n这些生命体展现给我的是他们的荣光，我并非真正地看见了他们。我实在很惬意。来自于一个有形有体的世界，我很高兴和这些新的无形状的生命在一起。这些生命体给了我此时此刻所需要的一切。\n让我吃惊和沮丧的是，他们似乎能知道我所想的一切。我不知道如何控制我的思想来保守秘密。\n我们开始进行思想交流，会话非常的自然、容易和随意。我听到他们的声音清晰而独特，每个生命体有不同个性的声音，但他们都直接对着我的思想说话而不是耳朵，他们使用普通的英语口语。我所想的任何事情他们都知道。\n他们似乎全都很了解我，完全熟悉我的思想和我的过去。我没有任何念头要从中寻找我已经认识的，因为他们全都了解我。没有人能比他们更了解我了。我也没有想到要去把他们看从自己的伯父和祖父，就像是在圣诞节时有许多的亲戚聚在一起，你无法记住每一个人的名字、他们是否已经结婚、跟你有什么联系，但你知道你是在和你的家人在一起。我不知道这些生命体跟我有没有关系，我只觉得他们比任何我认识的人都亲密。\n我和这些发光的生命体的谈话似乎延续了很长时间，从头至尾，我的身体都被那位笼罩着我的生命体扶着，从某种意义上讲，我们是完全固定地悬在空中的。周围到处都是无数发光的生命体，像空中的星星，来来去去。这场景就像是一个夸张的塞满了大量星星的星系。在那个中心硕大的光辉中，许许多多的光体挤在一起，你无法单独地分辩他们。每一个光体都与造物主很融洽，他们实在是一体的。\n我被告知，所有这些数不胜数的生命体不得不回到他们的源头的一个原因，是在这种和谐、合一的感觉中充满活力。相隔太久会让他们变弱，会让他们感到孤独。他们最大的快乐就是回到所有生命的源头。\n在最初的谈话中，他们仅仅是安慰我。\n我有点不安，因为我赤身裸体。刚才在黑暗中我丢失了我的病号袍，我是一个人，有一个身体。他们告诉我，这没关系，他们非常熟悉我的身体构造。渐渐地，我放松下来，不再试图用手遮掩我的私处。\n接下来，他们要谈论我的一生。让我惊讶地是我的一生在我的面前被播放了出来，距我大约只有六或八英尺的距离，从开始到结束。这个生命的回顾由他们很好的控制着，他们让我观看，但不是从我的观点出发。我看到自己的一生──整个过程是一节功课，虽然当时我还不知道这点。他们试图教导我一些东西，但我当时不知道这是一个教学经验，因为我不知道我还要回来。\n我们从头到尾地观看，有些事情他们慢下来，放大；有些事情一带而过。我的一生被以一种我从未想过的方式展现出来，所有我曾努力地为之奋斗而得到东西和赏识，无论是小学、中学、大学还是在我的职业生涯中，都被他们视为无关紧要。\n随着我的生命回顾的不断展现，我能感到他们的悲伤、痛苦和快乐。他们不说这是好的或坏的，但我能感觉得到。我能意识到他们漠不关心的事，比方说，他们并不轻视我在中学破记录的铅球成绩，但他们对它、还有许多我非常引以为傲的东西不以为然。\n他们总是对我与别人的相处有回应，不论长短。不幸的是，我对别人的反应大多数都比我应该做的差，我本应当用爱的方式。\n无论如何，在我的一生中，当我以爱的方式回应别人时，他们欢喜快乐。\n我发现自己在与别人的相处中，大多时候是操纵别人、表里不一。比方说，在我的职业生涯中，我看见自己以教授的身份坐在办公室里，当时有一名学生前来谈论个人问题，只见我表面上满有同情心、耐心和爱心，但在心里却是烦得要命，以至于在桌子底下看表，巴望着这名学生早点了事。\n当我还是一名十几岁的青少年时，我的父亲每天工作十二个小时，不堪重负，他也因此疏忽了我。当他下班回家时，我为了表示对他的愤恨，冷冰冰地不理会他，这使他很生气，他的怒气又让我更有籍口恨他。我们吵架，我的母亲则伤心不已。\n在我一生中的大部分的时间里，我都视父亲为恶棍，自己是受害者。当我和那些生命体回顾我的一生时，我恍然大悟：在每天结束的时候，我不是愉快地去问候父亲，而是频繁地去烦扰他，只是为了证明我的伤害是对的。\n我又看见在一个夜晚，我妹妹感到非常不舒服，我是如何走进她的卧室、拥抱着她，没有说一句话，我只是躺在那里，双臂抱着她。这成为我一生中最为得意的经历。\n爱的医治，启迪开悟\n如果不是我的朋友和他的朋友们的爱，整个生命的回顾会使我的情绪受到巨大的伤害，我一定会发疯。但我能感觉到他们的爱，每当我感到不安的时候，他们将画面关闭一会儿。他们纯粹是爱我，他们的爱是切切实实的，你能在身上感到它，在身内感到它，他们的爱穿透你。我希望我能向你解释清楚，但做不到。\n他们的爱医治了我，因为我的生命的回顾让人崩溃。我可怜地观看着，只有可怜。我不敢相信这些，但看上去是越来越糟，当我长大成人后，只是将青少年的愚昧、自私扩大了，这一切都是在成为好丈夫、好父亲和好公民的外表的下面，伪善得令人作呕。自始至终，他们的爱与我相伴。\n当回顾结束时，他们问我：“你有什么问题吗？”是的，我有成千上万的问题。\n比方说，我问道：“圣经怎么样？”\n“圣经的什么怎么样？”他们反问道。\n我问他们，圣经是否真实？他们说它是真实的；我又问他们，为何当我试图去读圣经时，看到矛盾百出？他们让我再看看我的生命回顾──有些情节我漏掉了，他们显现出来，我看到只有很少的几次我打开圣经，带着挑刺的想法去读它，我试图证明圣经不值得一读。\n我请他们留意，对我而言，圣经晦涩、平淡无奇。他们告诉我，圣经包含了属灵的真理，要想明白它就要在灵里去读它，要以虔诚的态度去读。我的这些朋友们都告知我，圣经不像其它的书。他们还告诉我，后来我也发现了这点，当你以敬虔的心去读圣经时，它会跟你说话，会向你揭示它的意义，用不着你冥思苦想。\n我的朋友们以非常有趣的方式回答了许多问题。他们很了解我的语气，当我在脑海中思考问题、在我说出问题前，他们就知道了。\n比方说，我问他们，哪个宗教最好？我期待的答案像是：“长老会。”我把他们都看成是基督徒。\n我得到的答案是：“让你最接近上帝的宗教是最好的宗教。”\n我又问他们是否有生命在其它的星球上，他们的回答让我惊讶：宇宙中充满了生命。\n因我害怕核战的大毁灭，我就问他们世界上是否会有一场核子大战，他们说，没有。这也让我惊奇，我就解释了一番，告诉他们我是如何生活在核战的阴影下，这也是我成为现在这个样子的一个原因，在我的一生中，充满了绝望，因为整个世界会被一阵核子狂风吹得无影无踪，没有什么值得留恋，也因此让我觉得想做什么就做什么，无关紧要。\n他们说：“不，不会有任何核战。”\n我说，你们绝对肯定吗？他们再次让我打消疑虑。我说你们怎么就能这么肯定呢？他们的回答是：“上帝爱世人。”\n他们告诉我，如果不销毁核武器的话，可能会有一、二件核武器意外的爆炸，但不会有核子大战。我又问，为什么会有那么多的战争呢？他们回答说，他们允许小部分的战争发生，走出战争后，仁爱会启动，人类会尝试创造，通过这小部分的战场，他们也让人类进入到他们的认识层面从而制止战争。\n科学技术和其它有益于人类的东西，他们告诉我，都是他们赐给人类的礼物──通过灵感。人们被逐步引领而有所发现，但其中的许多发现后来都被不正当地用来毁灭自己。我们会对这个星球造成巨大的损害，他们表示，星球上的一切都是上帝的创造，不仅是人，还有动物、树目、鸟类和昆虫等等。\n他们向我解释道，他们关心世界上所有的人而不是厚此薄彼。他们希望人人都认为别人比自己强、爱人如己甚至胜过爱自己。如果有人在世界的某个地方受到伤害，那么，我们也会受伤──我们痛痒相关，我们要帮助他们。\n我们的这个星球上已经进入到一个转折点，有史以来我们第一次有能力去做到全球相通，我们能成为一体。\n有人被赐于特别的恩惠来带领世界进入更美好的时代，去促进它的到来，这正是我们生活在美国的人。\n当我和他们谈论未来时──听起来似乎我已经逃避了未来的世界，他们明确地向我说明我们有自由意志。\n如果我们改变方法，我们就能改变他们展现给我看的未来。他们给我看了未来的景象，以我所体验到的而言，这要基于我们美国人在那时的作为。在这个未来中，将会发生全球性的巨大的不景气。然而，如果我们改变我们的行为，会有不一样的未来。\n我问他们怎么有可能来改变许多人的进程？我说，改变世上的任何事情，即使有可能话，也会是非常难的。我表示这是无望之举。\n我的朋友们非常清楚地向我解释，所发生的一切都是让一个人有改变，一个人经过努力，就会有另外的人变得更好。他们说，改变世界的唯一的方法就是开始改变一个人，一生二，二生三，如此下去，就会有显著的改变。\n我问他们在乐观的情况下──他们所期盼的改变已经发生，世界会走向何方？他们给我看的景象与我所想象的大相径庭，让我惊讶。\n我先前的想象有点电影《星球大战》的味道：太空时代、整容、科技，而他们给我看的几乎没有一点科技。\n在那个令人欣悦的未来中，人人，绝对是每一个人，他们大部分的时间所做的事是扶养儿童。人们首要关心的是儿童，大家都认为儿童是世上最珍贵的宝贝。这样，当儿童长大成人时，他们就不会忧虑、仇恨和对抗，有的只是巨大信用和相互的尊重。\n在这样的未来中，如果一个人遇到麻烦，整个群体都会关心到这个人与别人的不协调。人们通过在灵里祈祷和爱来振奋这个被烦恼困扰的人。\n人们在余下时间里做的事就是园艺。几乎不需要体力上的努力，通过祈祷，我看到那些植物结出丰硕的水果和菜蔬。万众一心，能通过祈祷来改变星球的气候。每个人都在相互信赖中工作──如果需要，人们可以呼风唤雨，也可以让艳阳高照。各样的动物也与人和谐相处。\n在这个最美好的世界上，人们对智慧而不是对知识感兴趣。这是因为人们处在一个必须是万事通的环境中，在知识的范畴内，他们可以简单地通过祈祷来接受。对他们而言，凡事都可以解决，他们能做他们想做的任何事。\n这里的人没有旅游热，因为他们能在灵里与世界上任何人沟通，没有必要到别的地方去。他们专注于自己的所在地及周围的人，没有必要去度假。度假干什么呢？他们已经十分快乐、圆满。\n在这个世界上，死亡是每个人经历了所需要经历的一切后来临的，它意味着躺下并得着释放。这时，灵魂会上腾，与降下来迎接他（她）的天使相见，集体中的人会在这个人的周围，兴高采烈，因为大家都洞悉天堂。他们能看见灵魂离去，继续它的未尽之旅，因它已经不适宜在这个世界上成长了。在这个世界上，死者在爱、欣赏、理解及与人和谐地配合等方面，都尽力而圆满了。\n我看到这个未来世界中的最美的风景是一个花园，上帝的花园。在这个花园中，最美丽的是人。人们降生来到这个世界，在认识上帝中不断地成长，然后，从这个物质世界毕业，脱下肉体的外壳，升上天堂──在那里，与上帝有更亲密的且不断成长的关系。\n[编者按：在霍华德·斯道姆的《我坠入死亡》（2000年）一书中，作者描绘了1985年在濒死经历中这些发光生命体给他看的人类未来。他说，1985年他们告诉他，冷战不久会结束，因为“上帝让人心改变，要去爱全世界的人”，斯道姆说：“在1985年，我被告知冷战会在几乎不流血的情况下结束。因为人们不愿意忍受独裁政府。”\n斯道姆写道，那些发光的生命体告诉他大约在2185年地球上要发生的事。他问他们：“在此变化中，美国会成为世界的领袖吗？”\n那些光体回答说：“美国已经被赐于机会去成为世界的导师，但给予的多收取的也多。已经赐于给美国的要超过给有史以来的任何一个国家，但美国在这些礼物上未能落落大方。如果美国继续贪得无厌地剥削世界上其它国家的资源，上帝的祝福将会离开它，它的经济将会崩溃并导致混乱。由于人的贪婪本性，人们会为了一小怀汽油而相互残杀。世人会惊恐地看着你们的国家被冲突彻底毁灭，其它国家不会施以援手，因为他们是你们剥削的牺牲品，他们会很高兴地看到如此自私的人灭绝。美国必须立即改变，成为仁慈、慷慨的楷模。今天，美国是向世界输出战争和暴力文化的头号大国。这快要结束了，因为你们拥有自我毁灭的种子。即使你们不自我毁灭上帝也要让这些结束，如果你们不改变的话。”\n斯道姆说：“……我不知道历史上最富裕的国家是命定要失去上帝的祝福还是要成为世界的灯塔。上帝还允许不公继续到何时？未来取决于我们现在所做的。上帝直接地干预人类事件。愿上帝的旨意行在地上如同行在天上。”\n霍华德·斯道姆的这些发光生命体朋友告诉他许多有关将要来临的新世界。据他们所说，上帝希望在未来的两百年开创新国度。为此，上帝已经废止了一些给人的自由意志，以便神启地控制一些人类事件。这个新世界的秩序，据斯道姆所说，会类似于一些濒死经历所描述的天堂。人们会如此平安祥和、彼此相爱的生活：用心灵感应交流；瞬间到达旅行地；不再需要衣物蔽体；狮子与羔羊躺在一起。]\n了解死后发生的事\n我问我的朋友和他的那些朋友们有关死亡的事──当我们死后会发生什么事？\n他们说：“当一个可爱的人死后，天使会下来见他，带他上去──开始是渐渐地，因为如果让他立刻见到上帝，他会受不了。\n天使知道各人的内心，用不着以炫耀的方式来证明什么，他们知道并供给我们所需，有时也许只是天堂的草坪，有时是其它的东西。如果一个人非常喜欢珠宝，它们会向他展现珠宝。我们看见的东西是我们进入灵界所需要的东西，在天堂里，这些东西是真实而神圣的。\n他们逐渐地教育我们这些灵体，带我们进入天堂。我们不断地成长，长大，脱去各样的欲念和那些基于动物禀性的、我们一生大部分时间为之争斗的东西，现世的各种欲望也渐渐去掉，我们不再为它们奋斗，我们回归到本来面目──神圣的一部分。\n这一切发生在可那些可爱的人身上，这些人友好而且爱上帝。我的这些朋友们清楚地告诉我，我们没有任何知识和权力去论断其它的人──人心直接与上帝相关联，只有上帝知道人的心眼如何。有些人我们认为卑劣可憎，但也许上帝在那里却正人君子；同样，我们认为有些人是好人，但在上帝眼里他们也许是黑心肠的伪君子。只有上帝知道各人的真实情况。\n上帝最后审判各人，也会允许一些人被那些臭味相投的生命体牵引到黑暗中，具体的情况就像我曾遇到的。我没有看到更糟糕的情形，但我猜测我看到的仅是冰山的一角。\n我理所当然地去那里──在适当的时间去了适当的地方，对我而言，地点和周围的人物都相合。上帝让我经历这些，然后将我从那里挪开，因祂在整个的过程中看到了救赎同，这是净化我的一种方法。那些没有被允许拉到黑暗中的人，是因为他们可爱的性情被向上、朝着光吸引。\n我从未见到上帝，也不在天堂，像是在郊外的出口。他们让我看了一些东西，我们谈了很长时间、很多事情。然后，我看了一下自己，发现自己熠熠发光，变得非常美丽，虽没有像他们那样美，但确实有了从未有过的光芒。\n没有准备再回到地球，我告诉他们我希望能永远地跟他们在一起。我说：“我准备好了，我准备像你们一样，永远地在这里。这太好了。我爱它，我爱你们。你们太奇妙了。”\n我知道他们爱我并了解我的一切。从现在开始，一切都会好起来。我问他们我能否摆脱我的身体──它无疑是个累赘，成为像他们那样的生命体，并拥有他们在我面前所展现的那种能力。\n他们说：“不，你必须回去。”\n他们向我解释：我实属尚待发展，回到以肉体存的方式中对我大有裨益。在我的人类生活中，我有机会成长，这样下次我跟他们在一起时会更和谐。我需要发展许多重要的品格才能像他们那样去从事他们所做的事。\n我告诉他们我不想回去，并试着跟他们讨论。我说，如果我有这样的想法──我将再次卷曲在深渊的话，我恳求跟他们呆在一起。\n我的朋友们说：“甚至当你在地球上亵渎上帝、待你周围的人像尘土一样时，我们曾经差派人试着帮助你、教导你真理。有我们给你这一切的爱之后，你不相信我们希望你完美吗？你真的相信从现在开始我们会分开吗？”\n我回答道：“但我自己的失败感怎么办？你们已经让我看到我能做得更好，但我相信我无法做到。我没那么好。”\n自私自利在我的心中涌起，我说：“不行，我不回去。”\n他们说：“有人在关心你。你的妻子、孩子、父母，你要为了他们而回去。你的孩子需要你的帮助。”\n我说：“你们能帮助他们。如果你们让我回去却事与愿违，如果我回去却犯错误，我无法承受。因为你们让我看到我能更有爱心，更富于同情心，但我却忘掉了这些，反而愧对别人，或对别人做了非常糟糕的事，我知道这会发生的，因为我是人，那样，我会沮丧，不能忍受，以至于我会自杀。即或因为生活美好我不会自杀，我也会发疯。所以你们不能打发我回去。”\n他们向我保证，错误是人类的可以接受的部分。\n“去吧，”他们说：“犯你要犯的错误，从错误中学习。”\n只要做我认为是正确的事，他们说，这样我就会在正道上。如果我犯了错误，我必须充分地认识到它是一个错误，然后简单地让它过去，只要试着不要再犯同样的错误。重要的是要尽力而为，以仁善、真理为准绳，不要为了赢得人的赞誉而妥协。\n“但是，”我说：“错误让我难受。”\n他们说：“我们爱你，包括爱你选取的方式、犯的错误及全部的你。你能感觉到我们的宽恕。任何时候，只要你愿意，你都能感受到我们的爱。”\n我说：“我不明白。我该怎么做？”\n“只要转向内心世界，”他们说：“只要祈求我们的爱。如果你诚心祈求，我们就会给你。”\n他们劝告我，当我犯了一个错误时，我要认识它并祈求宽恕，甚至在我祈求的话还未出口时，我已经被宽恕了──但我必须接受宽恕。首要的原则是我必须相信宽恕是真实的并且已经得到了。公开或私下地忏悔自己犯了错，然后祈求宽恕。接下来，如果我不接受宽恕，那就是侮辱他们了。我不要再反反复复地怀着负罪感，不要重复错误──我要从错误中学习。\n“但是，”我说：“我怎样才能知道哪些是对的选择？哪些是你们要我做的呢？”\n他们回答：“我们希望你做你自己想做的事。这意味着要做出选择──没有必要只有一个正确的选择，而是一个可能的范围。你要从这些可能中做出你的最好的选择。如果你这样做了，我们会在那里帮助你。”\n我没有轻易地放弃，和他们争辩：回去充满了问题，而留在这里却有我想要的一切。我质疑我有能力去在我的世界中去实现任何一件他们认为是重要的事。他们说，世界是至高者优美的表达，人们发现美或丑，取决于自己思路。\n他们解释道：我们这个世界的精妙和复杂超越了我的理解，但我可以是造物主的一个合用的器皿。每一个受造物都无限有趣，因为它是造物主的显示。带着好奇和快乐去探索这个世界是我的一个良机。\n他们从未直接地给我一个任务或目的。要我为上帝建一个大教堂或圣殿吗？他们说，这些是为了人性的需要。他们要我在活着的一生中，爱人而不是物。我告诉他们我并非好得像我向他们描绘的那样世故老练。他们让我放心，无论何时，只要我需要，我会得到适当的帮助。我要做的就是祈求。\n这些发光的生命体，我的老师们，让人心悦诚服。同时，我也强烈地意识到不远就是伟大的生命体──我所知道的造物主。他们从没有说过：“祂希望这样……”但这意思却蕴涵在他们所说的一切的背后。我不想同他们争论太多，因为至尊的生命体是这样的奇妙和让人敬畏，散发出的爱让人无法抗拒。\n我提出不想回到这个世界的最大的论据是，我告诉他们如果离开了他们和他们的爱，我会心碎，我会死。回去是如此的残酷，我说，我无法忍受。我请他们注意，世界充满了仇恨和对抗，我不想回到这个大旋涡中。离开他们我无法承受。\n我的朋友们说，他们从未与我分开。我解释道，我还不明白他们的显现，如果我回去，我又会不知道他们在那里。他们向我解释如何与他们沟通，告诉我要让自己清静下来，精神内敛，祈求他们的爱，然后，那爱便来临，我会知道他们在那里。\n他们说：“你不会离开我们。我们与你同在，永远这样。我们一直与你同在。”\n我说：“但是，我怎么知道呢？你们是这样说的，但当我回去后，这是否仅是一个美丽的理论。”\n他们说：“任何时候，只要你需要，我们就会在那里。”\n我说：“就是说你们会显现？”\n他们说：“不，不。除非你需要我们，否则我们不会以明显的方式去干涉你的生活。我们只是在那里，你会感觉得到我们的存在，会感觉得到我们的爱。”\n在他们这样解释后，我停止了争论。我说，我想\n我能回去了。随后，就那样，我回来了，回到了我的肉体中，疼痛仍在，比先前更厉害。\n（霍华德·斯道姆濒死经历的描述到此结束。）\n对霍华德来讲，回到现世的生活中并不容易，除了身体上的问题外，他还不得不面对另一个问题，那就是人们对他新的灵命的不理解和迟钝的反应。这在医院里就开始了，他说。\n霍华德说：“对每一个人我都感到了无法抵抗的爱意。我想拥抱、亲吻每个人，但我甚至坐不起来。我会对每一个人说：‘哦，你真美！’我成了那层楼里的笑料，大家感到这很滑稽。”\n像其它有过濒死经历的人一样，霍华德对别人的同感、同情心扩大了。他说，同自己的情感相比，他能更强烈地感受到别人的情感。之后，霍华德决定进入基督教界的事工。","price":"157.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Thiele,

In this brilliant short book, Vince Cable, 'the sage of the credit crunch' (\"Daily Telegraph\") explains how we got here and where we're going. In \"The Storm\", Vincent Cable explains the causes of the world economic crisis and how we should respond to the challenges it brings. He shows that although the downturn is global, the complacency of the British government towards the huge 'bubble' in property prices and high levels of personal debt, combined with increasingly exotic and opaque trading within the financial markets, has left Britain badly exposed. Yet we need to be vigilant in our response to the dangers confronting us. Times of crises inevitably bring forth false prophets who offer easy panaceas and identify scapegoats. However, Cable shows that an insular response to the current crisis would be a disaster and urges us to resist the siren voices that promote isolationism and nationalism as the answer to economic woes. He argues that policy makers must keep their faith in liberal markets if the remarkable advances in living standards, which are now being extended to the world's poorer countries, are to be maintained.

The Second World War lasted for 2,174 days, cost $1.5 trillion, and claimed the lives of more than 50 million people. What were the factors that affected the war's outcome? Why did the Axis lose? And could they, with a different strategy, have won? Andrew Roberts's acclaimed new history has been hailed as the finest single-volume account of this epic conflict. From the western front to North Africa, from the Baltic to the Far East, he tells the story of the war—the grand strategy and the individual experience, the cruelty and the heroism—as never before.   In researching this magnificently vivid history, Roberts walked many of the key battlefields and wartime sites in Russia, France, Italy, Germany, and the Far East, and drew on a number of never-before-published documents, such as a letter from Hitler's director of military operations explaining the reasoning behind the FÜhrer's order to halt the Panzers outside Dunkirk—a delay that enabled British forces to evacuate. Roberts illuminates the principal actors on both sides and analyzes how they reached critical decisions. He also presents the tales of many little-known individuals whose experiences form a panoply of the extraordinary courage and self-sacrifice, as well as the terrible depravity and cruelty, of the Second World War.   Meticulously researched and masterfully written,  The Storm of War  gives a dramatic account of this momentous event and shows in remarkable detail why the war took the course it did.","price":"USD 52.11"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["George R.

A STORM OF SWORDS is the third volume in the series. A beautifully presented slipcased edition of A STORM OF SWORDS. The Seven Kingdoms are divided by revolt and blood feud, and winter approaches like an angry beast. Beyond the Northern borders, wildlings leave their villages to gather in the ice and stone wasteland of the Frostfangs. From there, the renegade Brother Mance Rayder will lead them South towards the Wall. The men of the Night's Watch are ready for the coming of a great cold and the walking corpses that travel with it. But now they face a horde of wildlings twenty-thousand strong - hungry savage people steeped in the dark magic of the haunted wilderness - poised to invade the Kingdom of the North where Robb Stark wears his new-forged crown. But Robb's defences are ranged against attack from the South, the land of House Stark's enemies the Lannisters. His sisters are trapped there, dead or likely yet to die, at the whim of the Lannister boy-king Joffrey or his depraved mother Cersei, regent of the Iron Throne.

In The Perfect Moral Storm, philosopher Stephen Gardiner illuminates our dangerous inaction by placing the environmental crisis in an entirely new light, considering it as an ethical failure. Gardiner clarifies the moral situation, identifying the temptations (or \"storms\") that make us vulnerable to a certain kind of corruption. First, the world's most affluent nations are tempted to pass on the cost of climate change to the poorer and weaker citizens of the world. Second, the present generation is tempted to pass the problem on to future generations. Third, our poor grasp of science, international justice, and the human relationship to nature helps to facilitate inaction. As a result, we are engaging in willful self-deception when the lives of future generations, the world's poor, and even the basic fabric of life on the planet is at stake. We should wake up to this profound ethical failure, Gardiner concludes, and demand more of our institutions, our leaders and ourselves.","price":"$

Hanh\n一九二六年出生於越南中部，十六歲在慈孝寺披剃出家，為臨濟宗第四十二代傳人，隨後赴美研究並教學。一九六○年代越戰期間，禪師秉持「佛教必須入世」的信念，以堅實的修行為基礎，以具足的定力、慈悲與智慧濟世在戰火下煎熬的眾生，戰爭結束代表參加巴黎和談，之後一直留在西方弘法，並定期到世界各地帶領禪修活動。\n一九六七年美國黑人民權領袖小馬丁．路德．金恩提名他角逐諾貝爾和平獎。\n一九八二年他在法國南部建立了「梅村」（Village Des Pruniers）禪修道場，並赴世界各地弘法。\n一九九五年曾到台灣弘法並主持禪七法會。\n當今國際社會中最具宗教影響力的僧人之一，以禪師、詩人、人道主義者聞名於世。\n二○一一年再次受邀來台進行寶島諦聽之旅，包括在花博戶外會場的「百人花博自在行禪」。\n一行禪師通曉越、英、法及中文，除了佛學論述，著有詩集、小說、戲劇、傳記等，迄今有上百本著作，台灣出版品：《生生基督世世佛》、《步步安樂行》、《橘子禪》、《與生命相約》、《你可以不生氣》、《你可以不怕死》、《正念的奇蹟》、《觀照的奇蹟》、《見佛殺佛》、《你可以，愛》、《祈禱的力量》、《一心走路》、《生命真正的力量》、《建設淨土》、《一行禪師說佛陀故事》系列、《會心》、《自在》等二十多部。","summary":"你老是擔憂著事情可能出錯，你害怕說不對、做不好？\n你怕失去這個那個，你怕再好的關係終將分離？\n你老是擔憂著事情可能出錯，你害怕說不對、做不好？\n你怕失去這個那個，你怕再好的關係終將分離？\n請記得，恐懼的情緒就只是情緒，它來，停留一段時間，然後離去。\n你可以好好覺察它，照顧它。\n最慈悲的柔軟語，輕安自在的智慧\n一行禪師寫給每一個不想擔心害怕的人\n人們的擔心害怕，就像父母對子女的擔憂一般，連綿不絕。擔心他吃不飽、穿不暖，擔心他跟不上別人又怕他壓力太大，捧在手心怕他依賴長不大，放了手又時時憂心他被帶壞或傷害。一輩子憂心忡忡，你累了嗎？\n轉化心中的恐懼種子\n在佛教裡，我們說心識就像一塊田地，埋著各式各樣的種子，有慈、悲、喜、捨的種子；也有憤怒、恐懼、焦慮的種子；還有正念種子。把平安、喜悅和慈愛的種子帶到你的意識裡，讓它們形成能量，轉化你心中的恐懼種子。本書提供具體方法：釋放身心恐懼的八項正念修習、呼吸練習、放鬆禪、慈心禪。每刻都是一個機會，讓你與內在和好，重建平安和諧。\n多一點平安，少一點害怕\n每當恐懼、憤怒或妒忌這樣的強烈情緒生起時，我們要去照顧這些負面能量，否則它們就會將我們摧毀。無須以一種能量去對抗另一種能量，我們唯一需要做的是去照顧它們，轉化它們。對待我們的苦惱、痛苦和恐懼，需要抱持一種非暴力的態度。\n通過行禪、坐禪、呼吸、微笑和正念進食來接觸這顆正念種子，正念的能量就會不斷增長。而當我們需要正念能量時，只需碰觸那顆種子，正念能量就會產生，我們就可以用它去擁抱內心的強烈情緒。如此成功地修習一次，當強烈情緒再次生起時，我們就會有多一點的平安，少一點的害怕。\n覺知心中的恐懼，足以令人釋懷。了解恐懼從何而來，就能放下。無有畏懼，心便能輕安自在。","price":"260"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Arthur

正式推出\n★人與人的對話全球串聯中，靈魂的民權運動浪潮因之崛起……\n世界正在改變，但不是表面上看起來的那樣……\n近幾年，世界上發生許多重大的天災人禍，從阿拉伯世界領袖垮台，到造成上萬人受害的嚴重地震海嘯，末世論又蠢蠢欲動。這些災難代表了什麼？\n《與神對話》作者尼爾．唐納．沃許說，這些災難與亂象，不是毀滅的開始，一切只是「寧靜前的風雨」。激烈的動盪中，是要世人藉機了解：人的靈魂與意識狀態，與我們周遭的環境實相息息相關。\n地震，龍捲風，海嘯…是我們創造的？是的。\n全球暖化…是我們創造的？是的。\n倒不是說我們「故意」造成的，是我們「不知不覺」促成的，是我們舊有的集體意識形塑了現存的問題。而現在，正是人類意識與文化內涵「更新版本」的時候了。\n舊版本的人類意識，造成了許多競爭，壓力，恐懼。\n新版本的人類意識應該充滿愛，希望與關懷。\n能夠「更新版本」的關鍵，在於世人必須了解長久以來，舊意識中存有許多錯誤的認定：\n舊版本的人類意識認為，我們是由身體是心智組成的，忽略了其實我們還有靈魂。身體是靈魂的暫居之所，心智是幫助身體執行靈魂意識的工具。我們還敬畏、害怕「神」。認為「神」高高在上，我們不遵守祂的意志，就會受到懲罰。因此我們懷著恐懼過日子，要競爭，要表現好，要盡量上天的獎賞，避免懲罰。\n現在是人類意識轉型的時候了，透過人與人的對話與討論，認知並喚醒我們靈魂真正的本性。尼爾說，靈魂真正的本性是與神合一的，神不會懲罰人，神對人無所求，人在世間是基於愛，是來活出喜悅，創造美好的。因此，要改變世界的面貌，方法不是換一個政治領袖，不是改變經濟體制，而是人們能夠開始重新認識自己的靈魂真正的本性與追求。社會外在的制度結構與面貌，則都只是如實反映人們靈魂狀態而已。\n當一個人進入靈魂的探索，那個人就會改變。\n當一個團體一起進入靈魂的探索，那個團體就會改變。\n當整個社會進入靈魂的探索，整個社會都會改變。\n如此一來，很快的，許多社會的集體文化就會產生轉變，\n接著，整個世界就變了……\n在尼爾的號召下，一場「靈魂的民權運動」於焉展開，在世界各地開始串聯，所有人都可以從問自己七個幾個問題著手：\n1.為什麼69億人追求的東西都一樣？(平安，快樂，幸福，愛….)，而卻常常都實現不了？\n2.關於生命，有沒有我們不知道的事情，而當我們知道之後，會改變一切？\n3.有沒有可能，我們對自己其實不是全然了解，包含自己的生命及生命的目地，一旦了解之後，從此，就會改變我們看到的現實，轉變生命的經驗？\n4.我是誰？\n5.這裡是哪裡？\n6.我在這裡做什麼？\n7.我想要做什麼？\n本書特色\n《與神對話》是新世紀經典，曾經幫助許多追求個人靈修的人找到心靈安定的基礎。\n《與人對話》系列是作者在面對2012這個轉捩點，特別規劃出來為所有一般人所寫，內容更關心現實環境、更入世。除了一般人能讀，尼爾也號召新時代靈修的光行者，把這心靈法門更入世地運用出來，運用在更多層面，甚至協助旁人找到光與愛。\n【與人對話系列規劃】\n第一部

Birds with elegant wings, flowers in full bloom, insects which seem to have escaped a fairytale, dripping icicles, Greek Goddesses, baroque curls and elegant curves are invading the design world. \"Forms with Fantasy\" investigates and interprets this rampant trend for the first time. Over 100 designers illustrate how minimalism is becoming increasingly decorated, how they experiment with lace and cut-out techniques and how old styles can be brought up to date again and again.","price":"386.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["George R.R.

Lisia, a hostling in a secret Varrish breeding facility, completely isolated from society and forced to make pearls - new life - on demand by the military.After defeating Varrish rule, the Gelaming uncover the hidden facility, which has been abandoned by its administrators. Only a group of struggling survivors remain, Lisia and nearly two hundred juveniles.Lisia, suspicious and confused by these unfamiliar hara, is fearful of being evicted from the only home and lifestyle he has ever known, as well as losing custody of his charges. Warily, he forms an alliance with the young Lord Swift Parasiel, newly placed in power, and his illustrious hostling, Cobweb. Together these hara work to correct old wrongs, secure new rights, and challenge a liberation that at times feels more like conquest. The past and the present begin to overlap, as Lisia's chilling history is told through the pages of his diary and he struggles to fight for his future, and the welfare of those in his care.","price":"$ 22.59"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Storm, Gertrud

He's based in a leafy bit of south-west England, and when not struggling to meet deadlines enjoys running through scenic parts of it.”","summary":"","series":{"id":"1392","title":"Horus Heresy"},"price":"USD 7.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Citino, Robert M."],"pubdate":"2004-4","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"军事","title":"军事"},{"count":1,"name":"西方军事","title":"西方军事"},{"count":1,"name":"战略","title":"战略"},{"count":1,"name":"安全研究","title":"安全研究"},{"count":1,"name":"军事史","title":"军事史"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7411512.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"424","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7411512.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7411512.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7411512.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2450167\/","id":"2450167","publisher":"Univ Pr of Kansas","isbn10":"0700613005","isbn13":"9780700613007","title":"Blitzkrieg to Desert Storm: The Evolution of Operational Warfare","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2450167","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 45.14"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Clancy, Tom\/ Franks, Frederick M."],"pubdate":"2004-6","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"历史","title":"历史"},{"count":2,"name":"Non-Fiction","title":"Non-Fiction"},{"count":1,"name":"海湾战争","title":"海湾战争"},{"count":1,"name":"安全研究","title":"安全研究"},{"count":1,"name":"军事","title":"军事"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3260050.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"768","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3260050.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3260050.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3260050.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2947556\/","id":"2947556","publisher":"Berkley Pub Group","isbn10":"0425196771","isbn13":"9780425196779","title":"Into the Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2947556","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"From the #1 bestselling author and the commander who broke the back of the Republican Guard in the Gulf War. \n\n  The New York Times  Bestseller \n\n Includes an all new chapter on Operation Enduring Freedom \n\n  In his brilliant, bestselling novels, Tom Clancy has explored the most timely military and security issues of our generation.

In 1914, Germany launched an invasion of France through neutral Belgium—and brought the wrath of the world upon itself. Ypres became a place of horror, heroism, and terrifying new tactics and technologies: poison gas, tanks, mines, air strikes, and the unspeakable misery of trench warfare. Drawing on the journals of the men and women who were there, Winston Groom has penned a breathtaking drama of politics, strategy, and human heart.","price":"USD 14.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Barnstone, Tony (EDT)"],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"海外汉学","title":"海外汉学"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2952624\/","id":"2952624","publisher":"Univ Pr of New England","isbn10":"0819512109","isbn13":"9780819512109","title":"Out of the Howling Storm","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2952624","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"192.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["George R.R.

In the mid 90s he returned to prose, his first love, and began work on his epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire. He has been in the Seven Kingdoms ever since. Whenever he's allowed to leave, he returns to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he lives with the lovely Parris, a big white dog called Mischa, and two cats named Augustus and Caligula who think they run the place.","summary":"《冰与火之歌》英国版\nGeorge R.R. Martin's superb and highly acclaimed epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire, the richest, most exotic and mesmerising saga since The Lord of the Rings, continues with A Storm of Swords. There is passion here, and misery and charm, grandeur and squalor, tragedy, nobility and courage. The Seven Kingdoms are divided by revolt and blood feud, and winter approaches like an angry beast. Beyond the Northern borders, wildlings leave their villages to gather in the ice and stone wasteland of the Frostfangs. From there, the renegade Brother Mance Rayder will lead them South towards the Wall. The men of the Night's Watch are ready for the coming of a great cold and the walking corpses that travel with it. But now they face a horde of wildlings twenty-thousand strong -- hungry savage people steeped in the dark magic of the haunted wilderness -- poised to invade the Kingdom of the North where Robb Stark wears his new-forged crown. But Robb's defences are ranged against attack from the South, the land of House Stark's enemies the Lannisters. His sisters are trapped there, dead or likely yet to die, at the whim of the Lannister boy-king Joffrey or his depraved mother Cersei, regent of the Iron Throne. Cersei's ambition is unfettered while the dwarf Tyrion Lannister fights for his life, a victim of treachery. And on the other side of the ocean, the last of the Targaryens rears the dragons she hatched from her husband's funeral pyre. Daenerys Stormborn will return to the land of her birth to avenge the murder of her father, the last Dragon King on the Iron Throne.","price":"£11.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Third Book of the Wraeththu Histories","author":["Storm Constantine"],"pubdate":"2006-06-13","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"英文小说","title":"英文小说"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3506802.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"460","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3506802.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3506802.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3506802.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2965125\/","id":"2965125","publisher":"Tor Books","isbn10":"0765303485","isbn13":"9780765303486","title":"The Ghosts of Blood and Innocence","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2965125","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Darquiel har Aralis lives among the hidden tribe of Olopade, in ignorance of his identity, and as he grows up, Darq realizes he is different from any other har.
