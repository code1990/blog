Ratey）\n★哈佛大学医学院临床副教授，临床精神病医生、跨学科研究专家、畅销书作者，国际公认的神经精神医学领域专家。1997年荣获美国最佳医生。\n★发表超过60篇学术权威文章，8本书，被翻译成14种语言。与美国知名心理学医生爱德华•哈洛韦尔合著《分心不是我的错》一书，自1994年出版，该书始终被称为ADD-ADHD领域不可逾越的经典，直到今天仍是世界级别的畅销书籍。\n1. 揭开运动与大脑秘密的人\n运动、大脑、心理健康，这三个关键词几乎可以勾勒瑞迪教授的人生速描。20世纪70年代，约翰•瑞迪曾经居住在马拉松运动最为风靡的城市——波士顿，在这里，几乎人人都在跑步；在全民崇拜马拉松英雄Bill Roger的时代，实习医生瑞迪却遇见了另外一群特殊的人：因为受伤而被迫停止长跑的人。\n\"他们在停跑后，常常出现ADHD的特征：抑郁、注意力无法集中、拖延、无计划，他们有的是MIT和哈佛的教授，有的是企业领袖，这些事情之前在他们身上从来没有发生过。\"正是这样的特殊经历，让瑞迪教授专注于此20余年，如今，瑞迪教授是哈佛医学院精神病学系的临床副教授，攻击行为、自闭症、多动症、神经精神医学领域的世界级权威，在超过20年的研究中，他发现了运动与大脑间令人震撼的秘密。\n2. 掀起全球运动新浪潮的领军人\n＂运动是天然的健脑丸。以前我们常通过药物的方式治疗精神疾病，例如抑郁症、ADHD，而现在我更倡导用运动的方式强化大脑机能。对正常人来说，同样适用，运动可以让你更聪明！＂2008年，瑞迪教授出版的《运动改造大脑》一书意义非凡，1968年，肯尼斯•库伯的“有氧运动”理念，让我们认识到运动促进身体健康，而今瑞迪则点亮了运动带给头脑的好处，重新塑造了运动的新价值。\n《运动改造大脑》一书的出版奠定了瑞迪教授在大脑-运动关系领域的领袖地位。他开始着手在全世界范围内重塑学校、公司和个人的生活方式，通过运动达到巅峰绩效和良好的心理健康水平。迄今为止，火花计划（SPARK）已成为一项风靡全球的运动新理念，瑞迪教授的演讲足迹遍布加拿大、美国、日本、韩国、中国台湾、澳大利亚及欧洲等全球12个国家和地区。\n他还是大众媒体追逐的话题人物，美国主流媒体ABC，CBS，NBC，PBS，NPR争相采访，并荣登《纽约时报》《新闻周刊》《华盛顿邮报》《美国新闻》《世界报道》《时尚健康》等刊物。\n3. 锐步活力儿童计划形象大使\n2011年，瑞迪教授成为全球知名运动品牌锐步（Reebok）的儿童运动计划“活力儿童”项目（BOK）的形象大使，一改明星代言的模式，成为该品牌首位专业人士代言人。如今，BOKS项目已在美国的290所学校开展，并因此赢得了美国第一夫人米歇尔•奥巴马的嘉奖，预计到2013年底，这一数字有望达到750所。\n瑞迪教授的SPARK思想启迪了万千受不健康生活方式困扰的人，更为喜爱运动的人赋予更坚定的信心。2010年，台湾领导人马英九亲自力邀瑞迪教授赴台，在全台湾掀起“火花计划”热潮，台湾教育部门定制读本，4万青少年人手一册。作为“运动改造大脑”的受益者，马英九说出了大多数的心声，“以前，我只是觉得运动可以让我更健康，瑞迪教授的成果让我明白，运动还可以健脑，可以让我们的孩子更聪明。”","summary":"[内容简介]\n★为什么有些人成绩好，人缘也好？为什么有些人会玩，也会念书？因为他们的大脑结构不一样！\n想改造失控的大脑吗？快系上你的慢跑鞋，就能工作顺利、学业进步、心情好！\n做事不顺利，压力山大，抑郁缠身，忘东忘西、无法专注，紧张焦虑，请注意，你的脑细胞开始变少、海马变瘦、突出萎缩、血清素快要不够用了！\n★听听哈佛医学院教授瑞迪怎么说！《运动改造大脑》首度公开革命性的大脑研究，透过美国高中的体育改革计划、真实的案例与亲身经历、上百项科学研究证实，运动不只能健身、锻炼肌肉，还能锻炼大脑，改造心智与智商，让你更聪明、更快乐、更幸福！运动能刺激脑干，提供能量、热情和动机，还能调节脑内神经递质，改变既定的自我概念，稳定情绪，增进学习力。\n请别再久坐、抑郁、碎碎念、想不停，身体只要动起来，就能增长脑细胞、避开消极中枢，重新开拓新回路，排除诸如焦虑、抑郁、ADD、成瘾、经前综合征等困扰，还能减缓老化，预防阿尔茨海默病！\n★几十年前，库珀发现了运动与心脏的奥秘，瑞迪则在《运动改造大脑》一书中，通过确凿的证据、大量突破性研究揭示了运动与大脑的联系。所以，动起来吧！你的大脑会感谢您的付出，并加倍回报给你。\n别怀疑，你绝对有能力改造自己的大脑！想改善智商与心智吗？先穿上你的慢跑鞋吧！\n[编辑推荐]\n★中国新运动风潮引领者联袂推荐。万科集团执行副总裁毛大庆，联想集团副总裁

A woman experiencing a morning ritual she doesn't understand. Until he begins to read to her. The Notebook is an achingly tender story about the enduring power of love, a story of miracles that will stay with you forever. Set amid the austere beauty of coastal North Carolina in 1946, The Notebook begins with the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner returned home from World War II. Noah, thirty-one, is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories....until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again. Allie Nelson, twenty-nine, is now engaged to another man, but realizes that the original passion she felt for Noah has not dimmed with the passage of time. Still, the obstacles that once ended their previous relationship remain, and the gulf between their worlds is too vast to ignore. With her impending marriage only weeks away, Allie is forced to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can shape. Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. Shining with a beauty that is rarely found in current literature, The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters. \"I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.\" And so begins one of the most poignant and compelling love stories you will ever read....The Notebook\n\"Somewhere,\" muses Noah Calhoun, while sitting on his porch in the moonight, \"there were people making love.\" The Notebook, a Southern-fried story of love-lost-and-found-again, revolves around a single time-honored romantic dilemma: will beautiful Allison Nelson stay with Mr. Respectability (to whom she happens to be engaged), or will she choose Noah, the romantic rascal she left so many years ago?\nIn 1932, two North Carolina teenagers from opposite sides of the tracks fall in love. Spending one idyllic summer together in the small town of New Bern, Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson do not meet again for 14 years. Noah has returned from WWII to restore the house of his dreams, having inherited a large sum of money. Allie, programmed by family and the \"caste system of the South\" to marry an ambitious, prosperous man, has become engaged to powerful attorney Lon Hammond. When she reads a newspaper story about Noah's restoration project, she shows up on his porch step, re-entering his life for two days. Will Allie leave Lon for Noah? The book's slim dimensions and cliche-ridden prose will make comparisons to The Bridges of Madison County inevitable. What renders Sparks's (Wokini: A Lakota Journey of Happiness and Self-Understanding) sentimental story somewhat distinctive are two chapters, which take place in a nursing home in the '90s, that frame the central story. The first sets the stage for the reading of the eponymous notebook, while the later one takes the characters into the land beyond happily ever after, a future rarely examined in books of this nature. Early on, Noah claims that theirs may be either a tragedy or a love story, depending on the perspective. Ultimately, the judgment is up to readers?be they cynics or romantics. For the latter, this will be a weeper. Major ad\/promo; first serial to Good Housekeeping; movie rights to New Line Cinema; Warner Audio; Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club main selections.\nHere is a first novel that many people are banking on: the Literary Guild and Doubleday Book Club are featuring it as a main selection and film, foreign, and serial rights are already sold. At 80, Noah Calhoun reads daily from a notebook containing the love story of Noah and Allie. We learn of the teenaged lovers, their 14-year separation and reunion in New Bern, North Carolina, just weeks before Allie is to marry another man. Back in the present, we learn that Noah and Allie did marry and were happy for more than 40 years. Now, they are residents of a nursing home, separated both by rooms and, more profoundly, by Allie's Alzheimer's. Noah's daily reading from the notebook is not to himself; he reads aloud to Allie, hoping that the power of their love story will reach her. Noah's coping mechanisms as an old man are exceptional, and the novel's format, focusing just on the dual beginnings of their love story and its denouement, is intriguing. This is a more romantic testament to love's enduring miracle than Robert James Waller's The Bridges of Madison County (LJ 3\/1\/92) because the Calhouns chose the rigors of daily domestic life over a dream of four days. For all popular collections.\n-?Rebecca S. Kelm, Northern Kentucky Univ. Lib., Highland Heights\nWith a huge first printing and a major advertising campaign, Warner is clearly hoping that Sparks' first novel will duplicate the success of Robert James Waller's Bridges of Madison County. Written in the opaque language of a fable, the novel opens in a nursing home as 80-year-old Noah Calhoun, \"a common man with common thoughts,\" reads a love story from a notebook; it is his own story. In 1946, Noah, newly returned from the war, is trying to forget a long-ago summer romance with Allie Nelson, the daughter of a powerful businessman. Allie, soon to be married, feels compelled to track Noah down. One steamed-crab dinner and a canoe ride later, they fall madly in love again. We then learn that Noah, now aged and infirm, is reading his notebook to Allie in an attempt to jog her memory, severely impaired by Alzheimer's disease, and, miraculously, he succeeds, much to the amazement of the hospital staff. There is something suspect about a romantic relationship that reaches its acme when one of the partners is in the throes of dementia, but then, this is well within the confines of the romance genre--love conquers all, even Alzheimer's, leaving the medical experts (and this reviewer) confounded. If you want to read a novel in which the romance is grounded in something real, and the magic is truly magical, read the work of Alice Hoffman. If you want to read an upscale Harlequin romance with great crossover appeal, then read The Notebook.\nJoanne Wilkinson\nTwo ordinary people are rendered extraordinary by the strength, power and beauty of true love; each brings out the best in the other, and their pure love endures. The dual performance of Kate Nelligan and Campbell Scott enhances this smooth abridgment of Sparks's lyrical novel. With the perspectives of both characters presented, one has a sense of hearing the whole story. Nelligan's genteel, Southern tones blend perfectly with Scott's straightforward, gentle, often sensuous baritone. The readers deliver strong characterizations of both the younger, passionate lovers and the matured, easily fatigued, nursing home residents they become. Allie and Noah's heartrending story will touch the heart and soul of any listener who has ever loved a kindred spirit. J.H.B.An AUDIOFILE Earphones Award winner.\nSparks's debut is a contender in the Robert Waller book-sweeps for most shamelessly sentimental love story, with honorable mention for highest octane schmaltz throughout an extended narrative. New Bern is the Carolina town where local boy Noah Calhoun and visitor Allison Nelson fall in love, in 1932, when Noah is 17 and Allie 15 (``as he . . . met those striking emerald eyes, he knew . . . she was the one he could spend the rest of his life looking for but never find again''). Allie's socially prominent mom, however, sees their Romeo-and-Juliet affair differently, intercepting Noah's heartrendingly poetic love-letters, while Allie, sure he doesn't love her, never even sends hers. Love is forever, though, and in 1946 Allie sees a piece in the paper about Noah (he's back home after WW II, still alone, living in a 200-year-old house in the country) and drives down to see him, telling the socially prominent lawyer she's engaged to that she's gone looking for antiques (`` `And here it will end, one way or the other,' she whispered''). And together again the lovers come indeed, during a thunderstorm, before a crackling fire, leaving the poetic Noah to reflect that ``to him, the evening would be remembered as one of the most special times he had ever had.'' So, will Allie marry her lawyer? Will Noah live out his life alone, rocking on his porch, paddling up the creek, ``playing his guitar for beavers and geese and wild blue herons''? Suffice it to say that love will go on, somehow, for 140 more pages, readers will find out what the title means and may or may not agree with Allie, of Noah: ``You are the most forgiving and peaceful man I know. God is with you, He must be, for you are the closest thing to an angel that I've ever met.'' An epic of treacle, an ocean of tears, made possible by a perfect, ideal, unalloyed absence of humor. Destined, positively, for success.

Spark solves similar problems as Hadoop MapReduce does but with a fast in-memory approach and a clean functional style API. With its ability to integrate with Hadoop and inbuilt tools for interactive query analysis (Shark), large-scale graph processing and analysis (Bagel), and real-time analysis (Spark Streaming), it can be interactively used to quickly process and query big data sets.\nFast Data Processing with Spark covers how to write distributed map reduce style programs with Spark. The book will guide you through every step required to write effective distributed programs from setting up your cluster and interactively exploring the API, to deploying your job to the cluster, and tuning it for your purposes.\nFast Data Processing with Spark covers everything from setting up your Spark cluster in a variety of situations (stand-alone, EC2, and so on), to how to use the interactive shell to write distributed code interactively. From there, we move on to cover how to write and deploy distributed jobs in Java, Scala, and Python.\nWe then examine how to use the interactive shell to quickly prototype distributed programs and explore the Spark API. We also look at how to use Hive with Spark to use a SQL-like query syntax with Shark, as well as manipulating resilient distributed datasets (RDDs).\nWhat you will learn from this book\nPrototype distributed applications with Spark's interactive shell\nLearn different ways to interact with Spark's distributed representation of data (RDDs)\nLoad data from the various data sources\nQuery Spark with a SQL-like query syntax\nIntegrate Shark queries with Spark programs\nEffectively test your distributed software\nTune a Spark installation\nInstall and set up Spark on your cluster\nWork effectively with large data sets\nApproach\nThis book will be a basic, step-by-step tutorial, which will help readers take advantage of all that Spark has to offer.\nWho this book is written for\nFast Data Processing with Spark is for software developers who want to learn how to write distributed programs with Spark. It will help developers who have had problems that were too much to be dealt with on a single computer. No previous experience with distributed programming is necessary. This book assumes knowledge of either Java, Scala, or Python.","price":"USD 37.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Spark","author":["Steambot Studios"],"pubdate":"2010","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7025358.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"97","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7025358.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7025358.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7025358.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7163577\/","id":"7163577","publisher":"LeBox","isbn10":"0615377173","isbn13":"9780615377179","title":"Steampainting","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7163577","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Background:  STEAMBOT Studios is a collective of four digital artists working in the world of visual entertainment.

Ratey, MD.\n\n\nDid you know you can beat stress, lift your mood, fight memory loss, sharpen your intellect, and function better than ever simply by elevating your heart rate and breaking a sweat? The evidence is incontrovertible: Aerobic exercise physically remodels our brains for peak performance. \n\nIn SPARK, John J. Ratey, M.D., embarks upon a fascinating and entertaining journey through the mind-body connection, presenting startling research to prove that exercise is truly our best defense against everything from depression to ADD to addiction to aggression to menopause to Alzheimer's. Filled with amazing case studies (such as the revolutionary fitness program in Naperville, Illinois, which has put this school district of 19,000 kids first in the world of science test scores), SPARK is the first book to explore comprehensively the connection between exercise and the brain.

His siblings are Michael Earl Sparks (b. Dec. 1964), and Danielle Sparks (b. Dec. 1966, d. June, 2000). As a child, he lived in Minnesota, Los Angeles, and Grand Island, Nebraska, finally settling in Fair Oaks, California at the age of eight. His father was a professor, his mother a homemaker, then optometrist's assistant. He lived in Fair Oaks through high school, graduated valedictorian in 1984, and received a full track scholarship to the University of Notre Dame.\nAfter breaking the Notre Dame school record as part of a relay team in 1985 as a freshman (a record which still stands), he was injured and spent the summer recovering. During that summer, he wrote his first novel, though it was never published. He majored in Business Finance and graduated with high honors in 1988.\nHe and his wife Catherine, who met on spring break in 1988, were married in July, 1989. While living in Sacramento, he wrote his second novel that same year, though again, it wasn't published. He worked a variety of jobs over the next three years, including real estate appraisal, waiting tables, selling dental products by phone, and started his own small manufacturing business which struggled from the beginning. In 1990, he collaborated on a book with Billy Mills, the Olympic Gold Medalist and it was published by Feather Publishing before later being picked up by Random House. (It was recently re-issued by Hay House Books.) Though it received scant publicity, sales topped 50,000 copies in the first year of release.\nHe began selling pharmaceuticals and moved from Sacramento, California to North Carolina in 1992. In 1994, at the age of 28, he wrote The Notebook over a period of six months. In October, 1995, rights to The Notebook were sold to Warner Books. It was published in October, 1996, and he followed that with Message in a Bottle (1998), A Walk to Remember (1999), The Rescue (2000), A Bend in the Road (2001), and Nights in Rodanthe (2002), The Guardian (2003), The Wedding (2003), Three Weeks with my Brother (2004), True Believer (2005) and At First Sight (2005) all with Warner Books. All were domestic and international best sellers and were translated into more than 35 languages. The movie version of Message in a Bottle was released in 1999, A Walk to Remember was released in 2002, and The Notebook was released in 2004. The average domestic box office gross per film was $56 million -- with another $100 million in DVD sales -- making the novels by Nicholas Sparks one of the most successful franchises in Hollywood.\nThe film rights to Nights in Rodanthe, True Believer and At First Sight have been sold, and Nicholas Sparks has written the screenplay for The Guardian, though he has not offered it for sale at this point.\nHe now has five children: Miles, Ryan, Landon, Lexie, and Savannah. He lives in North Carolina with his wife and children.\nHis ancestry is German, Czech, English, and Irish, he's 5'10\" and weighs 180 lbs. He is an avid athlete who runs daily, lifts weights regularly, and competes in Tae Kwon Do. He attends church regularly and reads approximately 125 books a year. He contributes to a variety of local and national charities, and is a major contributor to the Creative Writing Program (MFA) at the University of Notre Dame, where he provides scholarships, internships, and a fellowship annually.","summary":"An angry rebel, John dropped out of school and enlisted in the Army, not knowing what else to do with his life--until he meets the girl of his dreams, Savannah. Their mutual attraction quickly grows into the kind of love that leaves Savannah waiting for John to finish his tour of duty, and John wanting to settle down with the woman who captured his heart. But 9\/11 changes everything. John feels it is his duty to re-enlist. And sadly, the long separation finds Savannah falling in love with someone else. \"Dear John,\" the letter read...and with those two words, a heart was broken and two lives were changed forever.

He's worked on interactive interfaces to the Scala compiler, while nourishing a strong enthusiasm for data analytics in his spare time, until Apache Spark let him fullfill this passion as his main job. He received the first Spark Certification in November 2014, and worked in London and Philadelphia, among other places.In his spare time, he can be found practicing one of a half-dozen ways of making coffee, climbing up or skiing down a not-necessarily-Alpine mountain, or sailing a not-necessarily coastal course.Gerard Maas is the lead engineer at Kensu.io, an early stage startup where he works on context management for big-data environments. Previous to that, he led the design and development of the data processing pipeline of Virdata.com, a startup building a cloud-native IoT platform, where Scala, Apache Spark and Spark Streaming were crucial building blocks. He enjoys contributing to open source projects, small and large. Through his career in technology companies like Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Labs, Sony and Technicolor, he has been mostly involved in the interaction of services and devices, from early days service adaptation when mobile screens only had few text lines, passing through multi-device interactions to IoT device management. He has a degree in Computer Engineering from the Simón Bolívar University, Venezuela.\nRead more","summary":"To build analytics tools that provide faster insights, knowing how to process data in real time is a must, and moving from batch processing to stream processing is absolutely required.

You will learn how to use Spark for different types of big data analytics projects, including batch, interactive, graph, and stream data analysis as well as machine learning. In addition, this book will help you become a much sought-after Spark expert.\nSpark is one of the hottest Big Data technologies. The amount of data generated today by devices, applications and users is exploding. Therefore, there is a critical need for tools that can analyze large-scale data and unlock value from it. Spark is a powerful technology that meets that need. You can, for example, use Spark to perform low latency computations through the use of efficient caching and iterative algorithms; leverage the features of its shell for easy and interactive Data analysis; employ its fast batch processing and low latency features to process your real time data streams and so on. As a result, adoption of Spark is rapidly growing and is replacing Hadoop MapReduce as the technology of choice for big data analytics.\nThis book provides an introduction to Spark and related big-data technologies. It covers Spark core and its add-on libraries, including Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, GraphX, and MLlib. Big Data Analytics with Spark is therefore written for busy professionals who prefer learning a new technology from a consolidated source instead of spending countless hours on the Internet trying to pick bits and pieces from different sources.\nThe book also provides a chapter on Scala, the hottest functional programming language, and the program that underlies Spark. You’ll learn the basics of functional programming in Scala, so that you can write Spark applications in it.\nWhat's more, Big Data Analytics with Spark provides an introduction to other big data technologies that are commonly used along with Spark, like Hive, Avro, Kafka and so on. So the book is self-sufficient; all the technologies that you need to know to use Spark are covered. The only thing that you are expected to know is programming in any language.\nThere is a critical shortage of people with big data expertise, so companies are willing to pay top dollar for people with skills in areas like Spark and Scala. So reading this book and absorbing its principles will provide a boost―possibly a big boost―to your career.","price":"USD 22.85"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":4,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Building scalable and fault-tolerant streaming applications made easy with Spark streaming","author":["Sumit Gupta"],"pubdate":"2015-10-1","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"Spark","title":"Spark"},{"count":1,"name":"大数据","title":"大数据"},{"count":1,"name":"DataScience","title":"DataScience"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28325583.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"200","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28325583.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28325583.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28325583.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26649761\/","id":"26649761","publisher":"Packt Publishing","isbn10":"1783987669","isbn13":"9781783987665","title":"Learning Real Time processing with Spark Streaming","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/26649761","alt_title":"","author_intro":"About the Author\nSumit Gupta\nSumit Gupta is a seasoned professional, innovator, and technology evangelist with over 100 months of experience in architecting, managing, and delivering enterprise solutions revolving around a variety of business domains such as hospitality, healthcare, risk management, insurance, and so on.

Hosted by novelist and journalist Kurt Andersen, the show is broadcast on 140 stations, and is heard by 500,000 listeners each week. For ten years, Studio 360 has probed the depths of creativity with influential figures from diverse fields who are shaping contemporary culture. Now, Studio 360 creator Julie Burstein takes the experience further, tracing the roots of the creative process with some the inventive thinkers and creative talents who have appeared on Studio 360 over the past 10 years-novelists Joyce Carol Oates and Isabel Allende; directors Ang Lee, David Milch and Mira Nair; musicians Rosanne Cash, Yo-Yo Ma, Robert Plant, and Joshua Redman; artists Chuck Close and Richard Serra-and others. In \"Spark\", Burstein pulls back the curtain to reveal sources of inspiration for these creators, and explores the strategies they employ to bring their work into being. Each chapter considers a particularly resonant facet of life from which creative minds draw: childhood adventures, a spouse's deathbed, conflicts with parents, the streets of a beloved hometown, seductive materials, a learning disability, and the natural world. Through \"Spark's\" stories about these contemporary alchemists, we, too, can learn how to bring creativity into our lives. These artists may not change lead into gold, Burstein writes, but they lift materials from their familiar contexts, combining, reshaping, transforming them into works of art that change the way we see the world.","price":"GBP

How is Chuck Close's portraiture driven by his inability to remember faces? What pivotal moment helped Rosanne Cash understand the healing power of the stage? Creativity is an elusive subject. We enjoy its fruits-movies, novels, paintings, songs-but rarely are we privy to what happens in the creative process. In \"Spark\", Julie Burstein traces the roots of some of the twenty-first century's most influential and creative thinkers, including Joyce Carol Oates, Yo-Yo Ma, David Milch, Isabel Allende, and Joshua Redman. Burstein pulls back the curtain to reveal the sources of these artists' inspiration and the processes that bring their work into being. These artists may not change lead into gold, Burstein writes, but they lift materials from their familiar contexts, combining, reshaping, transforming them into works of art that change the way we see the world. \"Spark\" is an invaluable resource for the aspiring writer and artist, but the need for creativity extends well beyond the world of paintbrushes and typewriters. Creativity is integral to business, parenting, education, science, and, perhaps most poignantly, our personal relationships.

Basic programming experience with Scala is assumed. Basic knowledge of Spark is assumed.\nWhat You Will Learn\nWrite, build and deploy Spark applications with the Scala Build Tool.Build and analyze large-scale network datasetsAnalyze and transform graphs using RDD and graph-specific operationsImplement new custom graph operations tailored to specific needs.Develop iterative and efficient graph algorithms using message aggregation and Pregel abstractionExtract subgraphs and use it to discover common clustersAnalyze graph data and solve various data science problems using real-world datasets.\nIn Detail\nApache Spark is the next standard of open-source cluster-computing engine for processing big data. Many practical computing problems concern large graphs, like the Web graph and various social networks. The scale of these graphs - in some cases billions of vertices, trillions of edges - poses challenges to their efficient processing. Apache Spark GraphX API combines the advantages of both data-parallel and graph-parallel systems by efficiently expressing graph computation within the Spark data-parallel framework.\nThis book will teach the user to do graphical programming in Apache Spark, apart from an explanation of the entire process of graphical data analysis. You will journey through the creation of graphs, its uses, its exploration and analysis and finally will also cover the conversion of graph elements into graph structures.\nThis book begins with an introduction of the Spark system, its libraries and the Scala Build Tool. Using a hands-on approach, this book will quickly teach you how to install and leverage Spark interactively on the command line and in a standalone Scala program. Then, it presents all the methods for building Spark graphs using illustrative network datasets. Next, it will walk you through the process of exploring, visualizing and analyzing different network characteristics. This book will also teach you how to transform raw datasets into a usable form. In addition, you will learn powerful operations that can be used to transform graph elements and graph structures. Furthermore, this book also teaches how to create custom graph operations that are tailored for specific needs with efficiency in mind. The later chapters of this book cover more advanced topics such as clustering graphs, implementing graph-parallel iterative algorithms and learning methods from graph data.\nStyle and approach\nA step-by-step guide that will walk you through the key ideas and techniques for processing big graph data at scale, with practical examples that will ensure an overall understanding of the concepts of Spark.","price":"USD 34.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Winsor, John"],"pubdate":"2010-4","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5613708.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"272","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5613708.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5613708.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5613708.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5306320\/","id":"5306320","publisher":"","isbn10":"1932841474","isbn13":"9781932841473","title":"Spark","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5306320","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The playing field for businesses is always changing.

What survives is shattered into enclaves-some tiny, some ruined, some wild. Into the gaps between settlements, and onto the Road that connects all human reality and the reality that is not human and may never have been human, have crept monsters. Some creatures are men, twisted into inhuman evil; some of them are alien to Mankind- And there are things which are hostile to all life, things which will raven and kill until they are stopped. A Leader has arisen, welding the scattered human settlements together in peace and safety and smashing the enemies of order with an iron fist. In his capital, Dun Add, the Leader provides law and justice. In the universe beyond, his Champions advance-and enforce-the return of civilization. Pal, a youth from the sticks, has come to Dun Add to become a Champion. Pal is a bit of a Maker, and in his rural home he's been able to think of himself as a warrior because he can wield the weapons of the Ancient civilization. Pal has no idea of what he's really getting into in Dun Add. On the other hand, the Leader and Dun Add have no real idea of what might be inside this hayseed with high hopes.

What survives is shattered into enclaves-some tiny, some ruined, some wild. Into the gaps between settlements, and onto the Road that connects all human reality and the reality that is not human and may never have been human, have crept monsters. Some creatures are men, twisted into inhuman evil; some of them are alien to Mankind- And there are things which are hostile to all life, things which will raven and kill until they are stopped. A Leader has arisen, welding the scattered human settlements together in peace and safety and smashing the enemies of order with an iron fist. In his capital, Dun Add, the Leader provides law and justice. In the universe beyond, his Champions advance-and enforce-the return of civilization. Pal, a youth from the sticks, has come to Dun Add to become a Champion. Pal is a bit of a Maker, and in his rural home he's been able to think of himself as a warrior because he can wield the weapons of the Ancient civilization. Pal has no idea of what he's really getting into in Dun Add. On the other hand, the Leader and Dun Add have no real idea of what might be inside this hayseed with high hopes. THE SPARK: A story of hope and violence and courage. And especially, a story of determination.

For over two decades, Cirque du Soleil has been a world-renowned laboratory of creativity, enthralling audiences around the world by fusing dazzling acrobatics, staging and choreography, and music, along with beautiful costumes and technical effects to inspire and create magical, almost otherworldly theatrical experiences. In The Spark, Cirque's former president of creative content, Lyn Heward, invites readers inside the world and ideas of Cirque du Soleil through the story of an ordinary man searching for meaning in his work and life.\n\nLike so many other people in their careers, sports agent Frank Castle has lost the passion he once had for his job. But a chance encounter with an inspiring Cirque du Soleil director takes him inside Cirque du Soleil to meet the artists, directors, designers, and technicians who create, shape, and perform in their acclaimed shows. As the story unfolds, the artists reveal surprising secrets about the sparks that ignite their creativity — from the pressure of deadlines and the exhilaration that comes from risking it all, to the chance encounters and everyday occurrences that have changed the way they live and work. As Frank comes to discover, every one of us is creative — wherever we work or whatever our job title is — but it’s up to us to tap into that powerful force. \n\nAs The Spark makes clear, there is no single formula for creative success–each of us must unlock the power of our imagination in our own way.

Creativity and innovation are widely recognised as essential to success in business. For over 20 years, Cirque du Soleil has been a world-renowned laboratory of creativity, enthralling audiences around the world by inspiring and creating a magical theatrical experience. In \"Cirque Du Soleil the Spark\", former president of creative content, Lyn Heward, invites readers inside the world and ideas of Cirque du Soleil through the story of an ordinary man searching for meaning in his work and life. As this book makes clear, there is no single formula for creative success - each individual must unlock the power of their imagination in their own way. An inspiring tale that draws on behind-the-scenes stories from the most creative people in entertainment, \"Cirque Du Soleil the Spark\" is an unparalleled guide on how to make creativity an integral part of business. \n\n From  Publishers Weekly  \nFor anyone who has ever marveled at the creativity, athleticism and magic of Cirque du Soleil, this book is a jewel that explores the showmanship, challenges and philosophies that have made Cirque an international sensation. Using a fictional narrative, Heward (former president and COO of Cirque's creative content division) and journalist Bacon follow a sports agent named Frank as he seeks the drive and enthusiasm that have faded from his career. Through a chance encounter while in Las Vegas, Frank sees a Cirque du Soleil performance and is enchanted. Before long Frank takes a leave of absence from his job and starts training with Cirque athletes in Montreal while giving the reader a behind-the-scenes look at how the Cirque sensation is created and the underlying philosophy. He gleans lessons on the value of working for a common goal, creating a meaningful experience for customers, using failure as a learning tool and how to reinvent oneself to find life's true path. While the scenarios that Frank encounters often seem too convenient, the book is captivating and offers important lessons that can be applied to many aspects of modern life. (Apr.) \n\n From  AudioFile  \nIf you've every wondered what it would be like to run away to the circus, this book might bring that spark to flame. Its account of one man's encounter with the Cirque du Soleil management system relates both information and inspiration for anyone seeking success. Narrator Christopher Evan Welch plays the part of a lost and lonely sports agent who stumbles backstage at a show in Las Vegas. This victim of burnout is looking for a spark to rekindle his interest in life and work. Listen as Welch increases his tempo as the author is challenged and enthusiastically meets those challenges under the tutelage of the coaches and managers of this world-class circus.

For anyone who wants to thrive in this new order, this requires a revolution in thinking--a steady stream of disruptive strategies and unexpected solutions. Disrupt: Think the Unthinkable to Spark Transformation in Your Business shows how to generate and execute those solutions--a disruptive approach for a disruptive age. Author Luke Williams demonstrates his experience creating disruptive products and services at frog design, one of the world's leading innovation firms. Williams combines the fluid creativity of \"disruptive thinking\" with the analytical rigor that is indispensable to business success. The result is a simple yet complete five-stage process for imagining a powerful market disruption and transforming it into reality. Using many examples and a book-length case study of Little Miss Matched, Williams shows how the more unexpected an idea, the smaller the number of competitors, and the more successful the company that brings it to market. He walks through generating a disruptive hypothesis, defining a disruptive market opportunity, creating multiple disruptive ideas, shaping them into an actionable solution, and persuading key stakeholders to adopt or invest in the solution. Disrupt offers readers a systematic way to redefine the future of a company, catch entire industries by surprise, and leave competitors scrambling to catch up.","price":"USD

Apache Spark is a big data processing framework perfect for analyzing near-real-time streams and discovering historical patterns in batched data sets. But Spark goes much further than other frameworks. By including machine learning and graph processing capabilities, it makes many specialized data processing platforms obsolete. Spark's unified framework and programming model significantly lowers the initial infrastructure investment, and Spark's core abstractions are intuitive for most Scala, Java, and Python developers.\nSpark in Action teaches you to use Spark for stream and batch data processing. It starts with an introduction to the Spark architecture and ecosystem followed by a taste of Spark's command line interface. You then discover the most fundamental concepts and abstractions of Spark, particularly Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) and the basic data transformations that RDDs provide. The first part of the book also introduces you to writing Spark applications using the the core APIs. Next, you learn about different Spark components: how to work with structured data using Spark SQL, how to process near-real time data with Spark Streaming, how to apply machine learning algorithms with Spark MLlib, how to apply graph algorithms on graph-shaped data using Spark GraphX, and a clear introduction to Spark clustering.","price":"USD

In  Closing the Innovation Gap , Judith Estrin provides the answers to these and other questions critical to our future. A technology pioneer and business leader, Estrin describes what will be required to reignite the spark of innovation in business, education, and government--ensuring our long-term success in the global economy.   Innovation does not occur in a vacuum. It grows from the interplay of three drivers of creative change--research, development, and application. Estrin calls this dynamic the “Innovation Ecosystem,” explaining how these communities work together to create sustainable innovation.    Closing the Innovation Gap  covers:     America's role as the primary driver of global innovation after World War II--explaining what worked, the subsequent decline, and how to regain traction  The fundamentals required to nurture innovation, including five simple but important values for transforming your organization into a force for productive change  How you can ensure that your business benefits from a thriving “Innovation Ecosystem”  Examples from both established companies, start-ups, and research labs that illustrate the power of innovation in providing a decisive business advantage and foundation for growth    Leaders in business and public service “must think beyond short-term financial results and understand the impact of globalization and an accelerated pace of change on future economic growth,” says Estrin. With  Closing the Innovation Gap  as your guide, business leaders will gain key insights into identifying their needs, asking the right questions, testing new ideas, and successfully leading their organization to the frontiers of twenty-first-century innovation.","price":"USD 27.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":7,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Amit Nandi"],"pubdate":"2016-2-4","tags":[{"count":6,"name":"Spark","title":"Spark"},{"count":4,"name":"Python","title":"Python"},{"count":1,"name":"肖凯","title":"肖凯"},{"count":1,"name":"Programming","title":"Programming"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28349387.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"146","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28349387.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28349387.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28349387.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26673270\/","id":"26673270","publisher":"Packt Publishing - ebooks Account","isbn10":"1784399698","isbn13":"9781784399696","title":"Spark for Python Developers","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/26673270","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 34.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":8,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Power of Questions to Open Doors, Uncover Solutions, and Spark Change","author":["Frank Sesno"],"pubdate":"2017-1-10","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"提问","title":"提问"},{"count":1,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":1,"name":"科普","title":"科普"},{"count":1,"name":"社科","title":"社科"},{"count":1,"name":"知识","title":"知识"},{"count":1,"name":"生活","title":"生活"},{"count":1,"name":"成长","title":"成长"},{"count":1,"name":"心理学","title":"心理学"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29466544.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"272","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29466544.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29466544.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29466544.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26954083\/","id":"26954083","publisher":"AMACOM","isbn10":"0814436714","isbn13":"9780814436714","title":"Ask More","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/26954083","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"What hidden skill links successful people in all walks of life? What helps them make smart decisions? The answer is surprisingly simple: They know how to ask the right questions at the right time.\nQuestions help us break down barriers, discover secrets, solve puzzles, and imagine new ways of doing things. But few of us know how to question in a methodical way. Emmy-award-winning journalist and media expert Frank Sesno aims to change that with Ask More.\nFrom questions that cement relationships, to those that help us plan for the future, each chapter in Ask More explores a different type of inquiry. By the end of the book, you’ll know what to ask and when, what you should listen for, and what you can expect as the outcome. Packed with illuminating interviews, the book explains:\n• How the Gates Foundation used strategic questions to plan its battle against malaria\n• How turnaround expert Steve Miller uses diagnostic questions to get to the heart of a company’s problems\n• How NPR’s Terry Gross uses empathy questions to dig deeper\n• How journalist Anderson Cooper uses confrontational questions to hold people accountable\n• How creative questions animated a couple of techie dreamers to brainstorm Uber\nBoth intriguing and inspiring, Ask More shows how questions convey interest, feed curiosity, and reveal answers that can change the course of both your professional and personal life.","price":"USD 25.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"The Creative Spark in Human Achievement","author":["William Duggan"],"pubdate":"2007-10-11","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"战略","title":"战略"},{"count":1,"name":"经管","title":"经管"},{"count":1,"name":"决策行为","title":"决策行为"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6995966.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6995966.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6995966.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6995966.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2225430\/","id":"2225430","publisher":"Columbia University Press","isbn10":"0231142684","isbn13":"9780231142687","title":"Strategic Intuition","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2225430","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"在线阅读本书\n\nHow \"Aha!\" really happens.     When do you get your best ideas? You probably answer \"At night,\" or \"In the shower,\" or \"Stuck in traffic.\" You get a flash of insight. Things come together in your mind. You connect the dots. You say to yourself, \"Aha!  I see what to do.\" Brain science now reveals how these flashes of insight happen. It's a special form of intuition. We call it strategic intuition, because it gives you an idea for action-a strategy.       Brain science tells us there are three kinds of intuition: ordinary, expert, and strategic. Ordinary intuition is just a feeling, a gut instinct. Expert intuition is snap judgments, when you instantly recognize something familiar, the way a tennis pro knows where the ball will go from the arc and speed of the opponent's racket. (Malcolm Gladwell wrote about this kind of intuition in  Blink .) The third kind, strategic intuition, is not a vague feeling, like ordinary intuition. Strategic intuition is a clear thought. And it's not fast, like expert intuition. It's slow. That flash of insight you had last night might solve a problem that's been on your mind for a month. And it doesn't happen in familiar situations, like a tennis match. Strategic intuition works in new situations. That's when you need it most.       Everyone knows you need creative thinking, or entrepreneurial thinking, or innovative thinking, or strategic thinking to succeed in the modern world. All these kinds of thinking happen through flashes of insight-strategic intuition. And now that we know how it works, you can learn to do it better. That's what this book is about.        Over the past ten years, William Duggan has conducted pioneering research on strategic intuition and for the past three years has taught a popular course at Columbia Business School on the subject. He now gives us this eye-opening book that shows how strategic intuition lies at the heart of great achievements throughout human history: the scientific and computer revolutions, women's suffrage, the civil rights movement, modern art, microfinance in poor countries, and more. Considering the achievements of people and organizations, from Bill Gates to Google, Copernicus to Martin Luther King, Picasso to Patton, you'll never think the same way about strategy again.     Three kinds of strategic ideas apply to human achievement:     * Strategic analysis, where you study the situation you face  * Strategic intuition, where you get a creative idea for what to do   * Strategic planning, where you work out the details of how to do it.     There is no shortage of books about strategic analysis and strategic planning. This new book by William Duggan is the first full treatment of strategic intuition. It's the missing piece of the strategy puzzle that makes essential reading for anyone interested in achieving more in any field of human endeavor.","price":"250.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":508,"average":"7.9","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"2006-10-30","tags":[{"count":114,"name":"NicholasSparks","title":"NicholasSparks"},{"count":98,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":68,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":67,"name":"爱情","title":"爱情"},{"count":30,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":21,"name":"外国文学","title":"外国文学"},{"count":21,"name":"Nicholas_Sparks","title":"Nicholas_Sparks"},{"count":18,"name":"情感","title":"情感"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2561898.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s2561898.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s2561898.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2561898.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1986891\/","id":"1986891","publisher":"Warner Books","isbn10":"0446528056","isbn13":"9780446528054","title":"Dear John","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1986891","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"When Savannah Lynn Curtis comes into his life, John Tyree knows he is ready to turn over a new leaf. An angry rebel, he had enlisted in the army after high school, not knowing what else to do. Then, during a furlough, he meets the girl of his dreams. Savannah Lynn Curtis is attending college in North Carolina, working for Habitat for Humanity, and totally unprepared for the passionate attraction she feels for John Tyree. The attraction is mutual and quickly grows into the kind of love that leaves Savannah vowing to wait for John while he finishes his tour of duty, and John realizing that he's ready to settle down with the young woman who has captured his heart. Neither can foresee that 9\/11 is about to change the world and will force John to risk every hope and dream that he's ever had. Like so many proud men and women, John must choose between love and country. And like all those left behind, Savannah must decide to wait or move on. How do we choose wisely?

With his calculated ability to throw your heart around like a yo-yo (try out his earlier Message in the Bottle or The Notebook if you really want to stick it to yourself), Sparks pulls us back to the perfect innocence of a first love.In 1958 Landon Carter is a shallow but well-meaning teenager who spends most of his time hanging out with his friends and trying hard to ignore the impending responsibilities of adulthood. Then Landon gets roped into acting the lead in the Christmas play opposite the most renowned goody two-shoes intown: Jamie Sullivan. Against his best intentions and the taunts of his buddies, Landon finds himself falling for Jamie and learning some central lessons in life.Like John Irving's A Prayer for Owen Meany, Sparks maintains a delicate and rarely seen balance of humor and sentiment. While the plot may not be the most original, this boy-makes-good tearjerker will certainly reel in the fans. Look for a movie starring beautiful people or, better yet, snuggle under the covers with your tissues nearby and let your inner sap run wild. --Nancy R.E.

It seems so basic. Why is it so hard to actually get right? According to innovation expert Phil McKinney, the real problem is that we’re teaching people to ask the wrong questions about their businesses—or none at all. There has to be a better way.\nIn Beyond the Obvious, McKinney will help you use his proven FIRE (Focus, Ideation, Rank, Execution) Method to dig deeper and get back to asking the right questions—the ones all companies must ask to survive. Full of real-world examples, this book will change the way you operate, innovate, and create, and it all begins with battle-tested questions Phil has gathered on note cards throughout his career. Shared for the first time here, these \"Killer Questions\" include:\nWhat are the rules and assumptions my industry operates under? What if the opposite were true?\nWhat will be the buying criteria used by my customer in 5 years?\nWhat are my unshakable beliefs about what my customers want?\nWho uses my product in ways I never anticipated?\nThese questions will reframe the way you see your products, your customers, and the way the two interact. Whether you're a company of thousands or a lean startup, Beyond the Obvious will give you the skills and easy-to-follow plan you need to make both the revolutionary changes and nuanced tweaks required for success.\nPraise for Beyond the Obvious\n\"Human beings are creatures of habit, so getting ourselves and our teams to think beyond the obvious is a challenge we face all the time.

For \"Garrett,\" the man who signs the letter, the message is the only way he knows to express his undying love for a woman he has lost. For Theresa, wary of romance since her husband shattered her trust, the message raises questions that intrigue her. Who are Garrett and Catherine? Where is he now? What is his story? Challenged by the mystery, and pulled to find Garrett by emotions she does not fully understand, Theresa begins a search that takes her to a sunlit coastal town and an unexpected confrontation. Brought together by chance-or something more powerful-Theresa and Garrett are people whose lives are about to touch for a purpose, in a tale that resonates with our deepest hopes for finding that special someone and everlasting love. Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity, Message in a Bottle takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love. For those who cherished The Notebook and readers waiting to discover the magic of Nicholas Sparks's storytelling, here is his new, achingly lovely novel of happenstance, desire, and the choices that matter most....","price":"GBP 7.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":235,"average":"8.2","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["（美）尼古拉斯·斯帕克思（Nicholas

A video game industry leader known by his handle \"Lord British\"—and a member of every gaming Hall of Fame—Richard pioneered the massively multiplayer, online role-playing game (MMORPG), and coined the term \"Avatar\" to describe an individual’s online character.\nA lifelong adventurer and member of the Explorers Club, Richard has used his extensive gaming fortune to finance thrilling expeditions. He has plumbed the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to see the remains of the Titanic, hunted for meteorites in Antarctica, and in 2008 became one of the first private citizens to be launched into space. On the leading edge of the private space industry—the man who arranged a zero-G flight for Stephen Hawking—Richard has invested his time and energy into making space travel more accessible.\nCombining the two guiding tenets of his life, exploration and creation, Richard now invites us on the great adventure that is his life and introduces us to the wondrous and magical in the world around us, including our own backyards. Yet Explore\/Create is no ordinary memoir; throughout, Richard engages readers with interactive activities and challenges them with \"secret codes\" for his games. An audacious genius with an insatiable curiosity and an irrepressible playfulness, Explore\/Create is enlightening, thrilling, and

世界由问题创造，由创意改变\/ 003\n如果不去探询，你就会对改变充满恐惧。但如果你对探询、尝试和连接各种事物并不感到烦恼，那么改变就会使你更具有冒险精神。而如果你能将改变看成是一种冒险，那么你就能开启一段探询的旅程。探询者获得的每个“答案”都会引发他们提出新一波的问题。\n◎ 如果他们能让一个人登上月球，为什么不能制作一只体面的假肢？\n◎ 提出问题比给出答案更有价值吗？\n◎ 为什么一切都以“为什么”开始？\n◎ 怎样将“提问”转化为“行动”？\n02 容忍笨问题，才能学聪明\/ 033\n小孩子的父母总是要不断去回答他们提出的问题。虽然我们口口声声说，佩服孩子的好奇心，但在某些时刻我们就是不欢迎他们提出的问题。但事实上，科学世界的许多领域都会被包含在“一个孩子提出的问题中”。\n◎ 为什么我们提问的次数会急剧减少？\n◎ 学校能基于问题来进行教学吗？\n◎ 如果探询能力与生俱来，那么为什么我们还需要学习？\n◎ 我们能自学质疑吗？\n第二部分 绝佳提问点燃创新力\n03 “为什么”，带着好奇心去发现生活\/ 069\n“为什么”阶段与发现和理解力有关。“发现”看似简单，好像只需要睁开双眼环顾四周就可以了，但很多时候，只有充满好奇心和天真的孩子才能发现那些别人错过的东西。而一个天真的孩子的问题，可能会改变商业游戏的规则。\n◎ 为什么照片不能即时成像？\n◎ 为什么退一步反而会帮助我们前进？\n◎ 为什么要付费与海豚一起游泳？\n◎ 为什么乔治•卡林能看到被我们所忽视的事物？\n04 “如果”，放飞你的想象力\/ 101\n在“如果”阶段，想象力开始发挥作用。长久以来，如果你都沉浸在一个想要解决的难题或问题中，那么你的大脑将会想出一系列可能的解决方案，而这些可能的解决\n方案则会最终通向答案。所以，“如果”问题拥有无穷的力量，它们是创新的种子。\n◎ 如果我们可以绘制音乐DNA图谱，那会怎么样？\n◎ 如果你的大脑是一片枝繁叶茂的森林，那会怎么样？\n◎ 如果只用圆点和破折号就能将这个世界分类，那会怎么样？\n◎ 如果你带着一个问题入眠，那么当你醒来时会得到答案吗？\n05 “怎样”，让看似不切实际的想法落地\/ 121\n很多时候，除非我们的想法已经非常成熟、臻于完美了，否则我们不会立刻尝试，不会分享给他人以获取反馈，也不会考虑其可行性。但是，过分思考和过度准备并不能自然而然地促使人们去探索和创造，你应该快速勇敢地从“如果”迈向“怎样”。\n◎ 怎样才能描绘出自己的想法？\n◎ 怎样搭建一座不倒塌的高塔？\n◎ 怎样学会去爱一只受伤的脚？\n◎ 怎样才能摆脱电源线的束缚？\n第三部分 探询改变商业，探询改变生活\n06 最具创意的领袖，专家级的探询者\/ 145\n当今商业领域的竞争愈加激烈，为应对这一变化，很多公司的领导者正逐渐意识到，如果他们仅仅提出一些不重要的问题，就无法推进他们的日常工作取得进展，无法提高他们所处的地位，也无法提升他们的品牌竞争力。而如果要创新，他们就必须提出更多更有价值的问题。\n◎ 如果我们的公司没有存在过，那会怎么样？\n◎ 有人会愿意追随一位“不靠谱”的领导吗？\n◎ 企业的使命宣言都应该包括一些有关使命的问题吗？\n◎ 怎样才能创建一种探询文化？\n07 拥抱未知，追逐自己的好奇心\/ 189\n当今世界，到处都是奇怪的难题，当然也有很多美丽问题。这就意味着，最棘手的问题往往就隐藏在某些看似普通但实际上极具价值的问题中。而如果我们发现了这些最棘手的问题，并不断围绕其进行思考，我们就可能会更清晰地看到问题的本质。\n◎ 你为什么要回避探询？\n◎ 如果你做出一点小改变，那会怎么样？\n◎ 如果你不会失败，那会怎么样？\n◎ 我们如何才能突破限制，绘出新篇章？\n译者后记\/

Where do new ideas come from, and once we have them, how can we carry them mentally into new situations? What allows our thinking to range easily over time, space, causation, and agency-so easily that we take this truly remarkable ability for granted?\nIn The Origin of Ideas, Mark Turner offers a provocative new theory to answer these and many other questions. While other species do what we cannot-fly, run amazingly fast, see in the dark-only human beings can innovate so rapidly and widely. Turner argues that this distinctively human spark was an evolutionary advance that developed from a particular kind of mental operation, which he calls \"blending\": our ability to take two or more ideas and create a new idea in the \"blend.\" Turner begins by looking at the \"lionman,\" a 32,000-year-old ivory figurine, one of the earliest examples of blending. Here, the concepts \"lion\" and \"man\" are merged into a new figure, the \"lionman.\" Turner argues that at some stage during the Paleolithic Age, humans reached a tipping point. Before that, we were a bunch of large, unimaginative mammals. After that, we were poised to take over the world. Once biological evolution hit upon making brains that could do advanced blending, we possessed the capacity to invent and maintain culture. Cultural innovation could then progress by leaps and bounds over biological evolution itself, leading to the highest forms of human cognition and creativity.\nFor anyone interested in how and why our minds work the way they do, The Origin of Ideas offers a wealth of original insights-and is itself a brilliant example of the innovative thinking it describes.","price":"USD

It encompasses the range of Spark's output, pursuing contextual lines of approach including biography, geography, gender, identity, nation and religion, and considering her legacy and continuing influence in the twenty-first century. Spark emerges here as a serious thinker on issues as diverse as the Welfare State, secularisation, decolonisation, and anti-psychiatry, and a writer whose work may be placed alongside Proust, Joyce, Nabokov, and Lessing. The critics collected here are mindful of how, although overwhelmingly known as a novelist, by the time of her first novel, The Comforters, in 1957, Spark already had a significant profile through poetry, biographical criticism, and literary journalism, as chair of the Poetry Society and editor of the Poetry Review, and as author or co-author of a number of scholarly studies of writers including Wordsworth, Mary Shelley, the Brontes, Cardinal Newman, and John Masefield. Within a relatively modest space this Companion touches on the whole range of Spark's work and, in introducing the oeuvre thematically for those looking to explore this elegant and challenging author further, also sets the agenda for future Spark studies.

Once we become aware of this, we start seeing them everywhere—in ads, apps, political debates, legal arguments, logos, and euphemisms, to name just a few. At their very best, analogies inspire new ways of thinking, enable invention, and motivate people to action. Unfortunately, not every analogy that rings true is true. That’s why, at their worst, analogies can deceive, manipulate, or mislead us into disaster. The challenge? Spotting the difference before it’s too late.\nRich with engaging stories, surprising examples, and a practical method to evaluate the truth or effectiveness of any analogy, Shortcut will improve critical thinking, enhance creativity, and offer readers a fresh approach to resolving some of today’s most intractable challenges.","price":"USD 27.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":158,"average":"7.9","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"Dec 01, 1999","tags":[{"count":27,"name":"爱情","title":"爱情"},{"count":24,"name":"notebook","title":"notebook"},{"count":17,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":16,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":13,"name":"NicholasSparks","title":"NicholasSparks"},{"count":9,"name":"外国文学","title":"外国文学"},{"count":8,"name":"感动","title":"感动"},{"count":7,"name":"the","title":"the"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1679192.jpg","binding":"Paper back","translator":[],"catalog":"\n      ","pages":"272 pages","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s1679192.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s1679192.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1679192.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1617408\/","id":"1617408","publisher":"WARNER BOOKS","isbn10":"0446676098","isbn13":"9780446676090","title":"THE NOTEBOOK","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1617408","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The novel was Sparks' first published novel, and the third written after The Passing of Wind and The Royal Murders, which were never published. It was written over a period of six months in 1994. Literary agent Theresa Park discovered Sparks after picking the book out of her agency's slush pile. Park liked it and offered to represent him. In October 1995, Park secured a $1 million advance for it from Time Warner Book Group, and the novel was published in October 1996. It was on the New York Times best-seller list in its first week of release. The Notebook spent over a year as a hardcover best

为降低读者学习大数据技术的门槛，书中提供了丰富的上机实践操作和范例程序详解，展示了如何在单机Windows系统上通过Virtual Box虚拟机安装多机Linux虚拟机，如何建立Hadoop集群，再建立Spark开发环境。书中介绍搭建的上机实践平台并不限制于单台实体计算机。对于有条件的公司和学校，参照书中介绍的搭建过程，同样可以实现将自己的平台搭建在多台实体计算机上，以便更加接近于大数据和机器学习真实的运行环境。 本书非常适合于学习大数据基础知识的初学者阅读，更适合正在学习大数据理论和技术的人员作为上机实践用的教材。","price":"99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Hands-on Big Data and Machine ...

Innovation expert Warren Berger shows that ability is both an art and a science.\nIt may be the most underappreciated tool at our disposal, one we learn to use well in infancy-and then abandon as we grow older. Critical to learning, innovation, success, even to happiness-yet often discouraged in our schools and workplaces-it can unlock new business opportunities and reinvent industries, spark creative insights at many levels, and provide a transformative new outlook on life. It is the ability to question-and to do so deeply, imaginatively, and “beautifully.”\nIn this fascinating exploration of the surprising power of questioning, innovation expert Warren Berger reveals that powerhouse businesses like Google, Nike, and Netflix, as well as hot Silicon Valley startups like Pandora and Airbnb, are fueled by the ability to ask fundamental, game-changing questions. But Berger also shares human stories of people using questioning to solve everyday problems-from “How can I adapt my career in a time of constant change?” to “How can I step back from the daily rush and figure out what really makes me happy?”\nBy showing how to approach questioning with an open, curious mind and a willingness to work through a series of “Why,” “What if,” and “How” queries, Berger offers an inspiring framework of how we can all arrive at better solutions, fresh possibilities, and greater success in business and life.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A friendship with Muriel Spark","author":["Alan Tylor"],"pubdate":"2017-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29984288.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"224","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29984288.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29984288.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29984288.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30439575\/","id":"30439575","publisher":"Polygon","isbn10":"1846974674","isbn13":"9781846974670","title":"Appointment in Arezzo","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30439575","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Alan Taylor has contributed to numerous publications, including The TLS, The New Yorker and The Melbourne Age, and edited four acclaimed anthologies – The Assassin’s Cloak (2000), The Secret Annexe (2004), The Country Diaries (2009) and most recently, Glasgow: The Autobiography (2016).","summary":"This book is an intimate, fond and funny memoir of one of the greatest novelists of the last century.

Three years later, she remains angry and alienated from her parents, especially her father . . . until her mother decides it would be in everyone's best interest if she spent the summer in Wilmington with him. Ronnie's father, a former concert pianist and teacher, is living a quiet life in the beach town, immersed in creating a work of art that will become the centerpiece of a local church. The tale that unfolds is an unforgettable story about love in its myriad forms - first love, the love between parents and children - that demonstrates, as only a Nicholas Sparks novel can, the many

She'd believed in it once, too, back when she was eighteen.\" \n\nIn the spring of 1984, high school students Amanda Collier and Dawson Cole fell deeply, irrevocably in love. Though they were from opposite sides of the tracks, their love for one another seemed to defy the realities of life in the small town of Oriental, North Carolina. But as the summer of their senior year came to a close, unforeseen events would tear the young couple apart, setting them on radically divergent paths.\n\nNow, twenty-five years later, Amanda and Dawson are summoned back to Oriental for the funeral of Tuck Hostetler, the mentor who once gave shelter to their high school romance. Neither has lived the life they imagined . . . and neither can forget the passionate first love that forever changed their lives. As Amanda and Dawson carry out the instructions Tuck left behind for them, they realize that everything they thought they knew -- about Tuck, about themselves, and about the dreams they held dear -- was not as it seemed. Forced to confront painful memories, the two former lovers will discover undeniable truths about the choices they have made. And in the course of a single, searing weekend, they will ask of the living, and the dead:  Can love truly rewrite the past?","price":"$

Apache Spark has quickly emerged as one of the most popu‐\nlar, extending and generalizing MapReduce. Spark offers three main benefits. First, it\nis easy to use—you can develop applications on your laptop, using a high-level API\nthat lets you focus on the content of your computation. Second, Spark is fast, ena‐\nbling interactive use and complex algorithms. And third, Spark is a general engine,\nletting you combine multiple types of computations (e.g., SQL queries, text process‐\ning, and machine learning) that might previously have required different engines.\nThese features make Spark an excellent starting point to learn about Big Data in\ngeneral.\nThis introductory book is meant to get you up and running with Spark quickly.\nYou’ll learn how to download and run Spark on your laptop and use it interactively\nto learn the API. Once there, we’ll cover the details of available operations and dis‐\ntributed execution. Finally, you’ll get a tour of the higher-level libraries built into\nSpark, including libraries for machine learning, stream processing, and SQL. We\nhope that this book gives you the tools to quickly tackle data analysis problems,\nwhether you do so on one machine or hundreds.","price":"US $39.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"2019-4","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"大数据","title":"大数据"},{"count":1,"name":"Spark","title":"Spark"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s32312663.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s32312663.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s32312663.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s32312663.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/33436902\/","id":"33436902","publisher":"机械工业出版社","isbn10":"7111624327","isbn13":"9787111624325","title":"Spark Streaming实时流式大数据处理实战","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/33436902","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":25,"average":"7.9","min":0},"subtitle":"世界著名创意大师的13种思维","author":["Michele M.

Other bestselling love stories followed (Message in a Bottle; A Walk to Remember; The Guardian), but Sparks's fans have from the very beginning eagerly anticipated a sequel to the romantic tale of Allie and Noah Calhoun. The wait is now over. Attorney Wilson Lewis has been married to Noah and Allie's daughter, Jane, for 30 years. Wilson and Jane have raised three children and lived a satisfying and prosperous life in the bucolic town of New Bern, N.C. After forgetting his anniversary, Wilson realizes that the passion and romance have gone out of his marriage and fears his wife no longer loves him. Being a methodical man, he decides to embark on a yearlong program to renew his romantic ties to his wife, seeking out the advice of Noah, who now spends his days in a retirement home feeding a swan he is sure is the reincarnation of his beloved Allie. In the midst of Wilson's machinations, his daughter Anna announces she is getting married. The upcoming wedding provides Wilson with the opportunity to bring his elaborate plan to fruition. Sparks tells his sweet story competently, without sinking too deeply into the mire of sentiment; a gasp-inducing twist comes at the very end. Satisfied female readers will close the covers with a sigh and a wish that a little of the earnest, too-good-to-be-true Wilson might rub off on their own bedmates.","price":"$7.99 US"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":10,"average":"7.5","min":0},"subtitle":"IQ和EQ大進步的關鍵","author":["John J.

At ninety-one years old, in poor health and alone in the world, he finds himself stranded on an isolated embankment after a car crash. Suffering multiple injuries, he struggles to retain consciousness until a blurry image materializes and comes into focus beside him: his beloved wife Ruth, who passed away nine years ago. Urging him to hang on, she forces him to remain alert by recounting the stories of their lifetime together – how they met, the precious paintings they collected together, the dark days of WWII and its effect on them and their families. Ira knows that Ruth can’t possibly be in the car with him, but he clings to her words and his memories, reliving the sorrows and everyday joys that defined their marriage.\nA few miles away, at a local rodeo, a Wake Forest College senior’s life is about to change. Recovering from a recent break-up, Sophia Danko meets a young cowboy named Luke, who bears little resemblance to the privileged frat boys she has encountered at school. Through Luke, Sophia is introduced to a world in which the stakes of survival and success, ruin and reward -- even life and death – loom large in everyday life. As she and Luke fall in love, Sophia finds herself imagining a future far removed from her plans -- a future that Luke has the power to rewrite . . . if the secret he’s keeping doesn’t destroy it first.\nIra and Ruth. Sophia and Luke. Two couples who have little in common, and who are separated by years and experience. Yet their lives will converge with unexpected poignancy, reminding us all that even the most difficult decisions can yield extraordinary journeys: beyond despair, beyond death, to the farthest reaches of the human heart","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":65,"average":"7.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"2010-9-14","tags":[{"count":15,"name":"NicholasSparks","title":"NicholasSparks"},{"count":9,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":9,"name":"爱情","title":"爱情"},{"count":8,"name":"Nicholas","title":"Nicholas"},{"count":6,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":5,"name":"英文小说","title":"英文小说"},{"count":5,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":5,"name":"Sparks","title":"Sparks"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9058856.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"544","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s9058856.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s9058856.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9058856.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6041956\/","id":"6041956","publisher":"Grand Central Publishing; Large Print edition","isbn10":"1455500380","isbn13":"9781455500383","title":"Safe Haven","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6041956","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Nicholas Sparks is one of the world’s most beloved storytellers.

Beautiful yet self-effacing, Katie seems determined to avoid forming personal ties until a series of events draws her into two reluctant relationships: one with Alex, a widowed store owner with a kind heart and two young children; and another with her plainspoken single neighbor, Jo. Despite her reservations, Katie slowly begins to let down her guard, putting down roots in the close-knit community and becoming increasingly attached to Alex and his family.   But even as Katie begins to fall in love, she struggles with the dark secret that still haunts and terrifies her . . . a past that set her on a fearful, shattering journey across the country, to the sheltered oasis of Southport. With Jo's empathic and stubborn support, Katie eventually realizes that she must choose between a life of transient safety and one of riskier rewards . . . and that in the darkest hour, love is the only true safe haven.","price":"USD 28.14"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":30,"average":"7.2","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"2001-8-1","tags":[{"count":10,"name":"NICHOLAS-SPARKS","title":"NICHOLAS-SPARKS"},{"count":8,"name":"NicholasSparks","title":"NicholasSparks"},{"count":7,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":6,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":4,"name":"romance","title":"romance"},{"count":3,"name":"love_story","title":"love_story"},{"count":2,"name":"英文原版书","title":"英文原版书"},{"count":2,"name":"romantic","title":"romantic"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24613795.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"\n      ","pages":"432","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s24613795.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s24613795.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24613795.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1341927\/","id":"1341927","publisher":"Grand Central Publishing","isbn10":"0446610399","isbn13":"9780446610391","title":"The Rescue","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1341927","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor McAden feels compelled to take terrifying risks to save lives. But there is one leap of faith Taylor can't bring himself to make: he can't fall in love. For all his adult years, Taylor has sought out women who need to be rescued, women he leaves as soon as their crisis is over and the relationship starts to become truly intimate. When a raging storm hits his small Southern town, single mother Denise Holton's car skids off the road. The young mom is with her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything. Taylor McAden finds her unconscious and bleeding, but does not find Kyle. When Denise wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone. During the search for Kyle, the connection between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. It will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love and will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain. This rescue will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.","price":"USD 7.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":43,"average":"8.3","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Muriel Spark"],"pubdate":"2000-2-24","tags":[{"count":14,"name":"英国","title":"英国"},{"count":11,"name":"文学","title":"文学"},{"count":11,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":11,"name":"MurielSpark","title":"MurielSpark"},{"count":7,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":7,"name":"English","title":"English"},{"count":4,"name":"英国小说","title":"英国小说"},{"count":4,"name":"Penguin_Modern_Classic","title":"Penguin_Modern_Classic"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s25980735.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"144","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s25980735.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s25980735.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s25980735.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2246380\/","id":"2246380","publisher":"Penguin Books, Limited (UK)","isbn10":"0141181427","isbn13":"9780141181424","title":"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2246380","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"在线阅读本书\n\nThe classic bestselling bookthe subject of a play, a movie, and a songthat tells the darkly fascinating story of a young, unorthodox teacher and her special, and ultimately dangerous, relationship with six of her students.   --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.","price":"GBP 8.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":43,"average":"7.5","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"2012-2","tags":[{"count":23,"name":"NicholasSparks","title":"NicholasSparks"},{"count":16,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":13,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":11,"name":"Romantic","title":"Romantic"},{"count":7,"name":"爱情","title":"爱情"},{"count":4,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":3,"name":"Fiction","title":"Fiction"},{"count":2,"name":"novel","title":"novel"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26628266.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"334","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26628266.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26628266.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26628266.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7066182\/","id":"7066182","publisher":"little brown","isbn10":"0751548553","isbn13":"9780751548556","title":"Lucky One","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7066182","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Is there really such a thing as a good luck charm?

As fate would have it, my father was a bartender and was scheduled to work that night, usually the busiest of the year. Short on tip money but long on pride, he demanded the finest obstetrician in Omaha and I was brought into this world kicking and screaming, the second son of Patrick Michael and Jill Emma Marie Sparks, in a family that would include an additional child (a daughter) the following year.\nMy family: (mom and dad, Micah (b. Dec. 1964) and Danielle (b. Dec. 1966) led a largely nomadic life in the beginning. Our father was still a student, working to get into a master's program, and he was eventually accepted to the University of Minnesota. I spent two years there and my memory of the place is limited. I had a dog named Pepper, a cardboard-box train I liked to sit in, and I remember picking bugs off the grille of the moving van when we finally left for Los Angeles in the summer of 1969.\nLos Angeles -- my home for the next four years while my father worked toward his Ph.D. at the University of Southern California -- is also fairly shadowy. I remember getting hit in the head with a brick thrown by an eighteen-year-old thug, learning to ride a bike (losing only one tooth in the process), and unfortunately, watching my pet turtle commit suicide by diving off our second-floor patio. In 1973, I went to Grand Island, Nebraska for a year with my mom (and brother Micah and sister Danielle) while my dad finished his thesis; then we all reunited in Fair Oaks, California, on December 1, 1974. I remember very clearly that Kolchak: The Night Stalker was on television the moment we arrived at our new house. Perhaps that's why I seem to associate Darrin McGavin with my adopted hometown.\n(Quick side-bar: because my father was a student until I was nine years old and my mother didn't work, we weren't exactly living the high life when I was little. I grew up on powdered milk and ate tons of potatoes, though to be honest, I never noticed how poor we really were until I was old enough to take an honest appraisal of things. Even then, it didn't matter. For the most part, I had a wonderful childhood and wouldn't change a thing.)\nAnyway, elementary school was fun, if a bit stressful at times. My third-grade teacher had flaming red hair, a big round face, and a fondness for Nile green evening dresses that draped her rather large body. I flunked my first English test, but since my papier-mache volcano spewed purple lava (baking soda, vinegar, and food coloring), my creativity was deemed sufficiently impressive for me to continue up the educational ladder.\nThe rest of my childhood was typical. Bike riding, exploring in the woods, playing in the American River, games with other kids in the neighborhood. Nothing special, nothing tragic. Just the life of an average little kid.\nHigh school was when things started to get interesting. For some reason, my brain kicked into high gear when I was fourteen and I didn't receive a grade lower than an A for the next four years. I ended up the valedictorian but couldn't give the commencement address. I was due in Los Angeles (again) for the state track meet. I broke a number of school and meet records during high school and received a full track scholarship to the University of Notre Dame. All this in addition to working thirty hours a week at a local restaurant. Life was busy in high school, but good. Darn good. Then, as it often seems to, my life took a U-turn and things got tough. During my freshman year in college, I got injured, went a little insane, and after breaking the Notre Dame record in the 4 x 800 relay (at the Drake relays -- a record that still stands), I spent the summer icing my Achilles tendon. During those three months, in which I was instructed not to run at all, I moped around the house until my mom got tired of it.\n\"Don't just pout,\" she said, \"Do something.\"\n\"What?\" I asked, not bothering to hide my sulking.\n\"I don't know. Write a book.\"\nI looked at her. \"Okay,\" I said.\nEight weeks later, I was the proud author of my first novel -- \"The Passing,\" a book that was never published. I laid it to rest in a literary graveyard of sorts -- my attic -- and I still keep it hidden away after all these years.\nFast-forward through college -- good friends, lots of football games, studying like crazy, competing in track -- until March 1988. I met a girl named Cathy on spring break in Florida. She was from New Hampshire and it was love at first sight, at least for me. I told her the day after we met that we would be married one day. She laughed and told me to get another beer. Two months later, after writing her about 150 letters, I graduated with high honors with a degree in Business Finance, and went out to visit her and meet her parents. She moved out to California in August 1988.\nIn July 1989, we married.\nSix weeks later, my mother was killed in a horseback riding accident at the age of 47. She and my father had been married 27 years and he took her loss very, very hard. So did we all. She was a great, great lady.\n1989 was also the year that I wrote my second novel, \"The Royal Murders.\" It's also in the attic, together with countless rejection slips. I decided to concentrate on another career. Since I'd not only been rejected by publishers but law school as well, I tried out a number of short-term jobs looking for something that captivated my interest. I appraised real estate, bought and restored houses, waited tables, sold dental products by phone and finally started my own business (manufacturing orthopedic products). Although I knew nothing about the medical field or engineering -- my science education began and ended with Biology 101 -- I put myself in charge of everything. Thirty- thousand dollars in credit-card debt later, I realized my folly, big as a whale. Being a Capricorn, I had no choice but to take a deep breath, roll up my sleeves, and avoid the evil-death-ray stares that my wife was laser-beaming into the back of my head. I pressed on and it eventually worked out -- sort of. After two and a half long, long years, I broke even. We celebrated our smashing success wildly and without care, and nine months later, my son Miles Andrew was born.\nDuring this time, I wrote yet another book, Wokini with Billy Mills, a long-time friend and Olympic Gold Medalist. It was published by Feather Publishing, a small outfit in Sacramento. It did well regionally (sales of about 50,000 copies) and was picked up by Random House in 1994. The success, I confess, was primarily due to the name recognition of Billy Mills. (Newer editions have been published by Hay House Books.)\nIn early 1992, I sold my business and looked around for something to do while I was still breathing. \"Pharmaceutical Sales\" the ad read. \"Okay,\" I said, and it was a really good choice at the time. The hours were good, the pay was good, and I only saw my boss once a month. Couldn't ask for anything more. I asked for and received a transfer from Sacramento to a small town in North Carolina, and in December 1992, we moved across the country to a place we'd never seen, where we could afford to buy a house and start living the American dream. We celebrated our arrival with champagne and candles, and nine months later, my son Ryan Cote was born.\nIt was also in late 1992 that I learned my younger sister Danielle had cancer. We kept our fingers crossed, said a lot of prayers, and as they tend to do, the years rolled on.\nMid-twenties life check. Good job, nice wife, cute kids, beautiful house overlooking a creek -- what more could there be? In May 1994, I found out. Cheers, the television show, broadcast its final episode. Bob Costas did an hour-long show prior to the episode and I remember lying awake most of the night after it aired. Cheers had been on for eleven years -- an entire era of my life -- and yet I realized that for the first time, I wasn't chasing my dreams anymore. My life was good, but I didn't want to look back from my deathbed and know I'd given that up trying to make my mark in the world. I decided I had to do something -- to chase a dream -- but what? My wife wasn't about to let me quit my job, so I decided that I'd give writing another shot. A real shot though, not a half-effort like before. I decided I could live with failure, but I didn't want to live the rest of my life knowing that I hadn't really tried. So, I decided to give myself three chances -- three more novels -- and if none of those was published, I'd be able to accept that I wasn't meant to be a writer.\nThen, of course, I had to decide on the story, and sure enough, I did.\nI wrote The Notebook over a six-month period, from June of 1994 until January of 1995, writing in the evenings from nine until midnight, and working one day on the weekends. In January 1995, I got transferred to Greenville, South Carolina and continued editing the book. In July 1995, I started soliciting agents, I found one, and the book was presented to publishers in October 1995. At the time, I was earning about $40,000 a year.\nWarner Books bought the rights for $1,000,000.\nIf you think I was excited about that, you're severely underestimating my response. I jumped up and down so long I got a cramp in my calf. I was hoarse for two days from screaming. I could barely sleep. It didn't seem real, but it was. And it was absolutely wonderful.\nThe first thing I bought was a new wedding ring for my wife. I remember getting down on my knees and telling her that our life just might be changing forever and that I didn't know what the future would bring. Then I asked her to marry me again. Film rights to the novel were sold later that week to New Line Cinema and that was exciting, too. Foreign rights were sold (eventually into more than 45 languages), and the novel was made a Main Selection of the Literary Guild. Life was grand. Life was awesome.\nAnd life, again, took another U-turn.\nTwo months later, in January 1996, I was told that my second son, Ryan, was autistic (a diagnosis that was later determined to be in error). It set off a year of tremendous worry and frustration.\nThen, in September, my father was killed in an automobile accident at the age of 54. His death devastated his community and our family.\nIn October, my book was launched.\nThat month, I started the book tour for The Notebook. 56 events in over 45 cities crammed into three months. It was the longest book tour in Warner Books's history -- one of the longest ever, period -- but it was important for me to do, despite the fact that only one person showed up in Miami and one person showed up in San Francisco for events in those cities. The Notebook steadily grew in popularity through word-of-mouth. It ended up spending 56 weeks on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list, and another 54 weeks on the paperback list. It was only the third novel in the previous thirty years that had lasted over a year on the hardcover list, and the only novel to last over a year on both hardcover and paperback lists, until J.K. Rowling came along with Harry Potter. To this point, it has sold over 10,000,000 copies worldwide.\nI continued selling pharmaceuticals through 1996 and into 1997, (long after The Notebook had been sold and published and while writing Message in a Bottle) for the simple reason that I didn't know if I could come up with another story or if I'd go down as a one hit wonder. I finally turned in the company car and hung up the suits for good in February 1997, when I thought Message in a Bottle was going well enough to give up the \"real\" job.\nBeginning in early 1997, I also started working with my son Ryan, trying to \"re- wire\" his brain, so to speak, through intensive therapy. I spent 3-4 hours a day teaching him the mechanics of speech in the hopes of aiding his development and getting him to talk. It was just about the hardest and yet most rewarding thing I've ever done.\nIn April 1997, movie rights for Message in a Bottle were sold to Warner Brothers, with Denise DiNovi producing, when the novel was about half-completed. The following month, my family moved back to North Carolina and I finished the book soon after that.\nLater that year, my sister's cancer reappeared, although the doctors were hopeful.\nMessage in a Bottle was published in the spring of 1998. I spent nearly two months on a book tour (50 events over 49 days, making it the second largest tour ever for Warner Books). The novel spent seven months on the best-seller list in hardback and another five months on the list in paperback. While on tour, I visited the movie set of Message in a Bottle while simultaneously working on a novel entitled \"The Best Man.\" The story just wasn't working out, however; I threw out 200 pages and knew I had to start over on a completely different story. In the summer of 1998, once the tour was completed, I wrote A Walk to Remember and spent part of the fall editing that book. In December 1998, film rights to A Walk to Remember were sold to Warner Brothers, with Denise DiNovi producing again.\nIn February 1999, the film version of Message in a Bottle premiered, starring Kevin Costner, Paul Newman and Robin Wright Penn. It opened at number one at the box office and went on to gross more than $120 million worldwide.\nBy that time, Ryan was improving weekly, and the accurate diagnosis of his problem -- CAPD (a condition almost like dyslexia of sound) -- made the future seem far more hopeful for him. For the first time since he'd been born, our worries about him were beginning to fade, since we knew he was going to be fine.\nI spent the spring and summer of 1999 writing The Rescue, which drew in large part on our experiences with Ryan. Since it was so emotional at times to write, my wife consoled me and offered support when I needed it. In July, my wife and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary, and wouldn't you know it? -- all that consoling had worked wonders and she was pregnant again.\nIn the fall of 1999, Ryan started kindergarten with other kids his age, in a regular, mainstream class. My wife and I were incredibly proud of him for all the work he'd done and all the struggles he'd had to overcome. (Miles had always been an excellent student, by the way).\nRight around the time school for Ryan began, A Walk to Remember was published and the book tour included 42 events in 37 cities in the U.S., and another few cities in Europe. In the end, it would spend nearly six months on the hardcover best-seller list, another five months on the paperback best seller list, and it became the most popular novel in hardcover that I'd written up to that point.\nThen, good and bad news came at once.\nIn January, 2000, my third son Landon was born. During that same month, we realized the drugs intended to control my sister's brain tumor were no longer working, and everyone in the family knew it was only a matter of time before she passed away.\nI spent the first six months of 2000 flying back and forth to California to visit her, which was heart-breaking for me. Sadly, she passed in early June 2000 at the age of 33.\nAs in 1998, during those six months while my sister was growing ill and I was bonding with my infant son, I tried writing a novel that didn't pan out. I again threw out 200 pages, and started A Bend in the Road in July, after my editor came down for a visit to help me come up with a story.\nIn the fall of 2000, I went on tour for The Rescue. 32 events over 29 days, and another 11 days in Europe. The novel hit #1 on the New York Times, Publishers Weekly, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today hardcover fiction lists, and spent nearly five months on the best-seller list. A couple of months later, I finished writing A Bend in the Road.\nIn January 2001, we started a massive landscaping project at our home since I'd always wanted a garden. It is, in all honesty, something to behold. As I like to tell people who ask if I did the work myself, \"With these two hands. . .\" I pause and hold my hands up, drawing attention to them, \"I wrote all the checks that paid people to do all this.\"\nAnyway, since it had been so busy for so long and I'd just finished my novel, my wife and I escaped for a romantic getaway weekend.\nSure enough, she was pregnant again.\nIn April, once the editing was completed on A Bend in the Road, I started my sixth novel, The Guardian. In May, filming for A Walk to Remember began, and in July, plans were made to adapt The Rescue into a television series.\nIn August, my twin daughters were born, Lexie Danielle and Savannah Marin.\nIn September, I went on tour for A Bend in the Road. This time, a smaller tour -- 20 events in the U.S. and a week in Europe, taking a little more than a month. Still far larger than most tours, but relatively small for me.\nThroughout the fall, negotiations continued for The Rescue to be adapted as a television series, with Denise DiNovi and I serving as executive producers. The film rights to A Bend in the Road were optioned, and I finished the first draft of The Guardian. I then adapted that novel into a screenplay.\nI also made the decision to support the creative writing department at the University of Notre Dame with a gift of $1,500,000, to be used for scholarships, internships, and fellowships annually.\nIn December 2001, I began my seventh novel, Nights in Rodanthe, and in January, 2002, I made the decision to publish that novel prior to The Guardian, given the structural challenges I was still wrestling with in that book. Nights in Rodanthe was completed in April, and I spent the summer editing and rewriting The Guardian. In September, Nights in Rodanthe debuted at #1 on the New York Times, Publishers Weekly, USA Today, and Wall Street Journal bestseller lists. The film rights to were sold to Warner Brothers, with Denise Di Novi again producing. The book tour covered 23 cities in 21 days, and upon my return, I finally finished editing The Guardian.\nNew Line Cinema's filming for The Notebook began in November 2002, with plans for a 2004 release. The film featured James Garner, Gena Rowlands, Ryan Gosling, and Rachel McAdams, and was directed by Nick Cassavetes, with Mark Johnson producing. In the fall of 2002 -- as the filming of The Notebook commenced -- I continued work on the adaptation of The Rescue as a weekly television series, and began writing my eighth novel, a sequel to The Notebook, The Wedding.\nIn early 2003, my brother and I spent three weeks traveling the world, and upon my return, I finished writing The Wedding. The Guardian was released in April 2003. I toured for a month, and the novel spent nearly five months on the best-seller list. Over the summer, I began work on my first non- fiction book entitled, Three Weeks with My Brother, and finished the first draft in September, just as The Wedding was to be published. The Wedding spent five months on the best seller list, and Three Weeks with My Brother was scheduled for publication in April 2004. In the midst of this busy year, I also learned that CBS passed on The Rescue as a television series, which was a bummer. You can't win them all. In April 2004, Three Weeks with My Brother was released, my brother and I toured eighteen cities, and it spent nearly six months on the non-fiction best seller list.\nIn June 2004, the film version of The Notebook was released, starring Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling. It was an amazing success, an instant movie classic, and a perfect companion to the book. Seeing it for the first time on screen, I was immensely flattered. The screenwriter, Jeremy Leven, drew heavily from the book. As an author, there's no finer compliment to receive.\nThat same summer, my oldest son, Miles, a seventh grader, began competing in track and field. I went out to the local public high school, where I'd been told they'd installed an all-weather track. I took a look, realizing it was nothing more than an oval, asphalt road. There wasn't a chance kids could practice on it without getting injured, so my wife and I decided to donate an all-weather tartan track, one that would foster a love of running and appreciation of an active lifestyle.\nI also decided to begin coaching the local high school track team, focusing on the 400m and 800m, for competition at the high school and Jr. Olympic level. Little did I know how much a part of life coaching would become over the next few years.\nIn August 2004, I was surprised when three of my novels, The Notebook, The Wedding, and Nights in Rodanthe, all appeared together on the New York Times paperback bestseller list. Around that time, I was also asked to serve on the USA Track and Field Foundation Board of Directors, an honor which I eagerly accepted.\nConstruction on the new track began in the fall of 2004, around the same time I began work on True Believer. For whatever reason, work on that novel was exceptionally slow. I completed the novel in January 2005, it was rushed into print and published in April, where, like most of my other novels, it spent approximately five months on the best seller list. The tour, by the way, was the shortest I've done -- only fourteen cities -- but that was largely due to the fact that I already had another deadline looming. Immediately after finishing True Believer, I had embarked on a sequel, my first attempt at writing what was essentially a two-part novel. The story in At First Sight picks up two weeks after True Believer left off, and I completed the novel in June 2005. With the editing completed by July, the publisher decided to publish it in October. It debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list.\nAutumn 2005, brought yet another undertaking when my wife and I sponsored a family from New Orleans, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The family - one member, a son, was a young athlete I had met the previous summer named Karjuan Williams - moved to New Bern, and my wife and I spent a lot of time and energy establishing them in a new household. Around that time, my wife and I began thinking more about the local school options for our kids while considering our own educational philosophies. Long story short, in early 2006, we joined with Tom McLaughlin to found The Epiphany School. The school opened later that fall with approximately 100 students in grades 6-10. The school's mission challenges students to pursue lifelong learning, faithful discipleship, courageous leadership, and compassionate service. As a college preparatory school, Epiphany offers a rigorous course load that is enhanced by travel in coordination with their studies. My intention is that, by the time every student has graduated, he or she will have visited 26 countries on six continents, whether it's studying history of the Americas among Mayan ruins, Ancient Greece at the Parthenon, or ecology and the environment in the rain forests of Costa Rica. Now, the school serves nearly 300 students, and encompasses grades 5-12.\nMeanwhile, between founding the school and coaching track and field at New Bern High School (the team would win both the indoor and outdoor state championships that spring), I was already hard at work on Dear John. The book was inspired by the movie Casablanca, one of my favorite films, and like Casablanca, Dear John explores what it really means to love another. The book was published in October 2006 again debuting at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list.\nI began writing my thirteenth book, The Choice, in early 2007. With The Choice, I wanted to return to the structure of The Notebook. That spring, New Bern High School reprised as North Carolina state champions in track and field, and as if there wasn't enough going on, my wife and I decided it was finally time to build our dream home. We met with the architect for the first time in August 2007, and that fall, I went on yet another book tour for The Choice.\nConstruction on the new home began in January 2008, around the same time I began writing my fourteenth novel, The Lucky One. Unlike many of my other novels, it was inspired not by life events, but by an image: an image of a soldier finding a photograph and eventually searching for the woman in it. The idea for the novel had been gestating for a while, mostly because I was unsure how to structure it, but once I got started on it, the writing went relatively smoothly. That spring, 2008, New Bern High School again won the state championship in both indoor and outdoor track and field, and the team was beginning to come into its own at the national level as well. In 2008, six different relay teams competed in the national championships, bringing home three gold medals, two silver medals, and a fourth place finish.\nI finished The Lucky One in June 2008; it was published in September. That fall was exceptionally busy: I had a media tour for the film version of Nights in Rodanthe, a U.S. book tour, and another book tour in Europe. At the same time, Dear John, starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried, began filming, and I spent some time at the set as well.\nSimultaneously, I was already working on a new project. In August 2008, I learned that Miley Cyrus was interested in the possibility of working with me, and after meeting with executives at Disney, I agreed to write a screenplay entitled The Last Song. Between those three tours, I worked on the screenplay throughout the fall, completing the first draft in December 2008, and the final polish in January 2009. After that, I immediately began writing the novel of the same name. It's odd, I know. Usually, screenplays are adapted from novels (not the other way around) but since I was responsible for both and scheduling necessitated that the film begin shooting in the summer of 2009, I had no other choice. The Last Song, which is both a love story and a coming of age novel, was completed in June 2009, right around the time that filming began.\nSpring 2009 brought other news as well. Film rights were sold for The Lucky One, and it is scheduled to begin filming in late 2010.  Dear John was released in February 2010, and The Last Song was released a short time later in April 2010.\nAnd as for the track team? New Bern again won the state championship (making four in a row), but the real thrills came at the national level. 2009 ended up being a season for the ages. In that year, New Bern High School ran the #1 U.S. time in seven different relays (something never done before), they won seven National Championships (something never done before), and they set three U.S. High School Records (something never done before). New Bern High School was recently voted the greatest high school relay team in history. (For those who want to see some of the races or read some of the articles that have been written about the team in 2008 and 2009, see Track and Field. Please note that in these races, the team is either referred to as New Bern High School, or Track Eastern Carolina.)\nWhich brings us, of course, to now. The house was finally completed, and  I largely retired from coaching.  But with the release of Dear John and The Last Song, 2010 was still an incredibly busy year.  I am looking forward to the release of Safe Haven in September 2010.\nAnd as always, life marches on.","summary":"When a mysterious young woman named Katie appears in the small North Carolina town of Southport, her sudden arrival raises questions about her past. Beautiful yet self-effacing, Katie seems determined to avoid forming personal ties until a series of events draws her into two reluctant relationships: one with Alex, a widowed store owner with a kind heart and two young children; and another with her plainspoken single neighbor, Jo. Despite her reservations, Katie slowly begins to let down her guard, putting down roots in the close-knit community and becoming increasingly attached to Alex and his family.\nBut even as Katie begins to fall in love, she struggles with the dark secret that still haunts and terrifies her . . . a past that set her on a fearful, shattering journey across the country, to the sheltered oasis of Southport. With Jo’s empathic and stubborn support, Katie eventually realizes that she must choose between a life of transient safety and one of riskier rewards . . . and that in the darkest hour, love is the only true safe haven.","price":"118.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":7,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"2003-10-01","tags":[{"count":8,"name":"Nicholas_Sparks","title":"Nicholas_Sparks"},{"count":6,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":2,"name":"爱情","title":"爱情"},{"count":2,"name":"恶魔的奶爸推荐","title":"恶魔的奶爸推荐"},{"count":2,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"有声书籍","title":"有声书籍"},{"count":1,"name":"①不可不读","title":"①不可不读"},{"count":1,"name":"2003","title":"2003"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1690893.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s1690893.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s1690893.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s1690893.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1830421\/","id":"1830421","publisher":"Warner Books","isbn10":"0446191884","isbn13":"9780446191883","title":"Nicholas Sparks Love Stories Three-Book Set (A Bend In the Road, The Rescue, Message in a Bottle)","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1830421","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Nichaolas Sparks Love Stories Three-Book Set (A Bend In the Road, The Rescue, Message in a Bottle)  \nFor a limited time get three of Nicholas Sparks&#146; popular fiction titles in one easy-to-order package, including the bestseller, Message in a Bottle.

It traces the evolution of thinking from attempts to spread 'modernity' by way of using the media through to alternative perspectives based on encouraging participation in development communication. The second: the elaboration of the theory of media imperialism, the criticisms that it provoked and its replacement as the dominant theory of international communication by globalization.","price":"USD 48.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":17,"average":"7.9","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"2006-1","tags":[{"count":4,"name":"NicolasSparks","title":"NicolasSparks"},{"count":1,"name":"我的书\/MyBooks","title":"我的书\/MyBooks"},{"count":1,"name":"novel","title":"novel"},{"count":1,"name":"Tragedy","title":"Tragedy"},{"count":1,"name":"Sparks","title":"Sparks"},{"count":1,"name":"Nicholas","title":"Nicholas"},{"count":1,"name":"Marriage","title":"Marriage"},{"count":1,"name":"Love","title":"Love"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10077361.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"352","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s10077361.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s10077361.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10077361.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1944398\/","id":"1944398","publisher":"","isbn10":"0751536571","isbn13":"9780751536577","title":"At First Sight","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1944398","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"There are few things Jeremy Marsh was sure he'd never do: he'd never leave New York City; never give his heart away again after barely surviving one failed marriage; and most of all, never become a parent.

Three years later, she remains angry and alientated from her parents, especially her father...until her mother decides it would be in everyone's best interest if she spent the summer in Wilmington with him. Ronnie's father, a former concert pianist and teacher, is living a quiet life in the beach town, immersed in creating a work of art that will become the centerpiece of a local church. The tale that unfolds is an unforgettable story of love on many levels--first love, love between parents and children -- that demonstrates, as only a Nicholas Sparks novel can, the many ways that love can break our hearts...and heal them.","price":"112.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":37,"average":"8.3","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["[美] Dean Wampler","[美] Alex

Conventional wisdom holds that copying kills creativity, and that laws that protect against copies are essential to innovation--and economic success. But are copyrights and patents always necessary? In The Knockoff Economy, Kal Raustiala and Christopher Sprigman provocatively argue that creativity can not only survive in the face of copying, but can thrive. The Knockoff Economy approaches the question of incentives and innovation in a wholly new way--by exploring creative fields where copying is generally legal, such as fashion, food, and even professional football. By uncovering these important but rarely studied industries, Raustiala and Sprigman reveal a nuanced and fascinating relationship between imitation and innovation. In some creative fields, copying is kept in check through informal industry norms enforced by private sanctions. In others, the freedom to copy actually promotes creativity. High fashion gave rise to the very term \"knockoff,\" yet the freedom to imitate great designs only makes the fashion cycle run faster--and forces the fashion industry to be even more creative. Raustiala and Sprigman carry their analysis from food to font design to football plays to finance, examining how and why each of these vibrant industries remains innovative even when imitation is common. There is an important thread that ties all these instances together--successful creative industries can evolve to the point where they become inoculated against--and even profit from--a world of free and easy copying.  And there are important lessons here for copyright-focused industries, like music and film, that have struggled as digital technologies have made copying increasingly widespread and difficult to stop. Raustiala and Sprigman's arguments have been making headlines in The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Financial Times, the Boston Globe, Le Monde, and at the Freakonomics blog, where they are regular contributors. By looking where few had looked before--at markets that fall outside normal IP law--The Knockoff Economy opens up fascinating creative worlds. And it demonstrates that not only is a great deal of innovation possible without intellectual property, but that intellectual property's absence is sometimes better for innovation.","price":"USD 27.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Critical Reader (Media Culture & Society series)","author":["Collins, Richard (EDT)\/ Curran, James (EDT)\/ Garnham, Nicholas (EDT)\/ Scannell, Paddy (EDT)\/ Schlesinger, Philip (EDT)\/ Sparks, Colin (EDT)\/ Hall, Stu"],"pubdate":"1986-09-01","tags":[{"count":4,"name":"Media,Culture&Society","title":"Media,Culture&Society"},{"count":2,"name":"英文版","title":"英文版"},{"count":2,"name":"传播学","title":"传播学"},{"count":2,"name":"GW","title":"GW"},{"count":1,"name":"新闻传播","title":"新闻传播"},{"count":1,"name":"外文参考文献","title":"外文参考文献"},{"count":1,"name":"传播理论","title":"传播理论"},{"count":1,"name":"传媒","title":"传媒"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2767185.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"368","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s2767185.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s2767185.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2767185.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2307590\/","id":"2307590","publisher":"Sage Publications Ltd","isbn10":"0803997493","isbn13":"9780803997493","title":"Media, Culture & Society","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2307590","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"\"Media, Culture & Society\" has pioneered a unique approach to media analysis.

Reminding himself daily of his hard-earned lessons, the last thing he is looking for is a serious relationship.\nMaria Sanchez, the hardworking daughter of Mexican immigrants, is the picture of conventional success.

Now, if the young lovers are to have any kind of future at all, Jeremy must make a difficult choice: return to the life he knows, or do something he could never do before - take a giant leap of faith. \n\n Book Dimension   \nlength: (cm)17.1    　　　            　　　　　            　　　　　 width:(cm)10.5","price":"80.0"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":7,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"Jun 01, 2006","tags":[{"count":4,"name":"NicholasSparks","title":"NicholasSparks"},{"count":3,"name":"英文小说","title":"英文小说"},{"count":2,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":1,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":1,"name":"当代","title":"当代"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"外国文学","title":"外国文学"},{"count":1,"name":"Sparks","title":"Sparks"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2761130.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"480","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s2761130.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s2761130.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2761130.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2112257\/","id":"2112257","publisher":"TIME WARNER PAPERBAC","isbn10":"0751538906","isbn13":"9780751538908","title":"The Rescue","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2112257","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"When confronted by raging fires or deadly accidents, volunteer fireman Taylor Mc Aden feels compelled to take terrifying risks -- risks no-one else in the department would ever take -- to save lives.

These four novels, each a miniature masterpiece, illustrate her development over four decades. Despite the seriousness of their themes, all four are fantastic comedies of manners, bristling with wit.\n\nSpark’s most celebrated novel,  The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie , tells the story of a charismatic schoolteacher’s catastrophic effect on her pupils.  The Girls of Slender Means  is a beautifully drawn portrait of young women living in a hostel in London in the giddy postwar days of 1945.  The Driver’s Seat  follows the final haunted hours of a woman descending into madness. And  The Only Problem  is a witty fable about suffering that brings the Book of Job to bear on contemporary terrorism.\n\nAll four novels give evidence of one of the most original and unmistakable voices in contemporary fiction.

Though they were from opposite sides of the tracks, their love for one another seemed to defy the realities of life in the small town of Oriental, North Carolina. But as the summer of their senior year came to a close, unforeseen events would tear the young couple apart, setting them on radically divergent paths.\n\nNow, twenty-five years later, Amanda and Dawson are summoned back to Oriental for the funeral of Tuck Hostetler, the mentor who once gave shelter to their high school romance. Neither has lived the life they imagined . . . and neither can forget the passionate first love that forever changed their lives. As Amanda and Dawson carry out the instructions Tuck left behind for them, they realize that everything they thought they knew -- about Tuck, about themselves, and about the dreams they held dear -- was not as it seemed. Forced to confront painful memories, the two former lovers will discover undeniable truths about the choices they have made. And in the course of a single, searing weekend, they will ask of the living, and the dead:  Can love truly rewrite the past?","price":"CDN$

21隨即推出了一款只要四十美元的連身裙，它和希爾頓身上那件Foley + Corinna的連身裙相似度沒有百分之一百也有百分之九十九！許多Forever 21的顧客，不管他們是否知道Forever 21涉嫌抄襲，他們購買Forever 21的裙子，只是因為他們喜歡裙子的設計，而且也一樣只要用「十分之一」的價格就能買到。\n身為認真創作的苦主設計師，通常是巴不得這些公司都能被法律與道德審判，但在美國，除非真的觸犯到商標法，否則作品本身的抄襲是不被規範的，然而更奇妙的是，對於時尚圈而言，很少人會花大把力氣上法院，抄襲甚至被看成是產業循環的一部份！\n法律背景出身的兩位作者卡爾．勞斯迪亞和克里斯托夫．斯布里格曼，就是利用這些對於抄襲有著高容忍度的行業，去探討無法可管，是不是真的會造成創新的滅亡？傳統觀念中，我們的確認為模仿、抄襲就是壞事，仿製品將會扼殺一切創新。然而，真的是這樣嗎？這在本書中，透過許多不同行業的故事舉例——時尚、美食、喜劇、橄欖球、字體、金融、音樂，我們可以看到，模仿與創新這把雙面刃，在某些情況下，限制的確保護了創新的根基，但在其他情況下，法律的不規範反而能促成更強大的創造力。在這些特定的行業中，抄襲與模仿的盛行，非但沒有讓這些產業走向滅亡，反而帶起一波又一波的流行。\n在這本書中，透過一個又一個與我們日常息息相關的各種產業案例，我們或許能重新檢視，到底什麼是「創新」？世界上是否存在著「百分百的創新」？而什麼樣的法律限制（或者不限制），才能既保護創新的基底，又能促成創新的發展？","price":"NT$

Her autobiography, Curriculum Vitae, recorded her early years but politely blurred her darker moments: troubled relations with her family, a terrifying period of hallucinations, and disastrous affairs with the men she loved.At the age of nineteen, Spark left Scotland to get married in southern Rhodesia, only to divorce and escape back to Britain in 1944. Her son returned in 1945 and was brought up by Spark s parents while she established herself as a poet and critic in London. After converting to Catholicism in 1954, she began writing novels that propelled her into the literary stratosphere. These came to include Memento Mori, The Girls of Slender Means, and A Far Cry from Kensington. With The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961), later adapted into a successful play and film, Spark became an international celebrity and began to live half her life in New York City. John Updike, Tennessee Williams, Evelyn Waugh, and Graham Greene applauded her work. She had an office at The New Yorker and became friends with Shirley Hazzard and W. H. Auden. Spark ultimately settled in Italy, where for more than thirty years until her death in 2006 she shared a house with the artist Penelope Jardine.Spark gave Martin Stannard full access to her papers. He interviewed her many times as well as her colleagues, friends, and family members. The result is an indelible portrait of one of the most significant and emotionally complicated writers of the twentieth century. Stannard presents Spark as a woman of strong feeling, sharp wit, and unabashed ambition, determined to devote her life to her art. Muriel Spark promises to become the definitive biography of a literary icon.","price":"USD 35.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks","Micah Sparks"],"pubdate":"2006-1","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"2006","title":"2006"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4190492.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"356","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4190492.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4190492.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4190492.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4305340\/","id":"4305340","publisher":"Perfection Learning","isbn10":"0756963060","isbn13":"9780756963064","title":"Three Weeks with My Brother","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4305340","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 23.10"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Colin"],"pubdate":"2007-12","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"媒体","title":"媒体"},{"count":1,"name":"全球化","title":"全球化"},{"count":1,"name":"Globalization","title":"Globalization"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8048815.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"264","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8048815.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8048815.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8048815.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2399100\/","id":"2399100","publisher":"Sage Pubns","isbn10":"0761961615","isbn13":"9780761961611","title":"Globalization, Development and the Mass Media","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2399100","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Development, Globalization and the Mass Media gives a comprehensive and critical account of the theoretical changes in communication studies from the early theories of development communication through to the contemporary critiques of globalization.

It traces the evolution of thinking from attempts to spread 'modernity' by way of using the media through to alternative perspectives based on encouraging participation in development communication.

After thirty years, Wilson Lewis is forced to face a painful truth: the romance has gone out of his marriage. His wife, Jane, has fallen out of love with him, and it is entirely his fault. Despite the shining example of his in-laws, Noah and Allie Calhoun, and their fifty-year love affair (originally recounted in The Notebook), Wilson himself is a man unable to express his true feelings. He has spent too little time at home and too much at the office, leaving the responsibility of raising their children to Jane. Now his daughter is about to marry, and his wife is thinking about leaving him. But if Wilson is sure of anything, it is this: His love for Jane has only grown over the years, and he will do everything he can to save their marriage. With the memories of Noah and Allie's inspiring life together as his guide, he vows to find a way to make his wife fall in love with him...all over again. In this powerfully moving tale of love lost, rediscovered, and renewed, Nicholas Sparks once again brings readers his unique insight into the only emotion that ultimately really matters.","price":"USD 8.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":4,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"2009-09-08","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"NicholasSparks","title":"NicholasSparks"},{"count":1,"name":"2009","title":"2009"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3829239.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"400","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3829239.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3829239.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3829239.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3786513\/","id":"3786513","publisher":"Grand Central Publishing","isbn10":"0446547565","isbn13":"9780446547567","title":"The Last Song","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3786513","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"#1 bestselling author Nicholas Sparks's new novel is at once a compelling family drama and a heartrending tale of young love.

With aplomb, however, Mrs. Hawkins confidently set about putting things to order, little imagining the mayhem which would ensue.

Many commentators have seen stories like this, and TV shows like Jerry Springer's, as evidence of a decline in the standards of the mass media. This increasing interest in private lives and the falling off of coverage of serious news is often described as Otabloidization.O The essays in this book are the first serious scholarly studies of what is going on and what its implications are. Reality, it turns out, is much more complex than some of the laments suggest. As the contributors show, this is not just a U.S. problem but is repeated in country after country, and it is not certain that the media anywhere are getting more tabloid. What is more, there is no consensus about whether tabloidization is just Odumbing downO or whether it is a necessary tactic for the mass media to engage with new audiences who do not have the news habit. Tabloid Tales will be of interest to students and scholars in journalism, mass communication, political science, and cultural and media studies.","price":"USD 53.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks Nicholas"],"pubdate":"2005-05-19","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"英文原版","title":"英文原版"},{"count":1,"name":"英文","title":"英文"},{"count":1,"name":"2012","title":"2012"},{"count":1,"name":"2005","title":"2005"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4241322.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4241322.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4241322.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4241322.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4729991\/","id":"4729991","publisher":"Little, Brown Book Group","isbn10":"0316731234","isbn13":"9780316731232","title":"True Believer","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4729991","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Glenn Grayson"],"pubdate":"2009-2","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"参考文献","title":"参考文献"},{"count":1,"name":"media-research","title":"media-research"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4796933.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4796933.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4796933.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4796933.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4877607\/","id":"4877607","publisher":"","isbn10":"0495568546","isbn13":"9780495568544","title":"Media Effects Research","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4877607","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"MEDIA EFFECTS RESEARCH, International Edition provides an excellent introduction for students studying mass media's effects on society.

For over two decades, Cirque du Soleil has been a world-renowned laboratory of creativity, enthralling audiences around the world by fusing dazzling acrobatics, staging and choreography, and music, along with beautiful costumes and technical effects to inspire and create magical, almost otherworldly theatrical experiences. In  The Spark , Cirque's former president of creative content, Lyn Heward, invites readers inside the world and ideas of Cirque du Soleil through the story of an ordinary man searching for meaning in his work and life.\n\nLike so many other people in their careers, sports agent Frank Castle has lost the passion he once had for his job. But a chance encounter with an inspiring Cirque du Soleil director takes him inside Cirque du Soleil to meet the artists, directors, designers, and technicians who create, shape, and perform in their acclaimed shows. As the story unfolds, the artists reveal surprising secrets about the sparks that ignite their creativity — from the pressure of deadlines and the exhilaration that comes from risking it all, to the chance encounters and everyday occurrences that have changed the way they live and work. As Frank comes to discover, every one of us is creative — wherever we work or whatever our job title is — but it’s up to us to tap into that powerful force. \n\nAs  The Spark  makes clear, there is no single formula for creative success–each of us must unlock the power of our imagination in our own way. An inspiring tale that draws on behind-the-scenes stories from the most creative people in entertainment as well as some out-of-this-world Cirque du Soleil magic,  The Spark  is an unparalleled guide on how to make creativity a part of everything you do.\n\n\nLyn Heward is the former President and COO of Cirque du Soleil’s Creative Content Division and is currently acting as executive producer for a variety of special projects.

unravels the universal from the individual in human development to answer the question: what are we born with and what do we learn? In 1984, Basic published Harvard developmental psychologist Jerome Kagan's The Nature of the Child, a book that challenged many of psychology's most deeply held assumptions about human development-arguing, for example, that early experience does not inexorably shape our lives and that the influence of the family is more subtle than had been supposed-and which went on to become a classic in its field. In The Human Spark, Kagan offers a sweeping narrative of development that solidifies his place as one of the most influential thinkers in the field of psychology. Taking into account how far the science of child development has advanced in the last 28 years - with the ascendancy of cognitive psychology, neurobiology, and molecular biology, as well as much deeper research into development on the broader human scale - Kagan explores the tension between influences of biology and environmental factors in development. This book will incorporate new research on the neurobiology and cognition of infants and children through the framework of the child's experience, the role of the local setting, the influence of social class, and the biological biases that each individual brings to her circumstances. Kagan also considers such issues as the degree to which early events affect later outcomes, whether children can actually have some understanding of math and physics in the crib, and the rise of the diagnosis of mental illness in children. A profound exploration of what is universal and what is individual in human development, The Human Spark is the result of a scientist's lifelong quest to discover how we become who we are.","price":"USD 28.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Beistegui, Miguel De (EDT)\/ Sparks, Simon (EDT)"],"pubdate":"2000-2-2","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"艺术哲学","title":"艺术哲学"},{"count":2,"name":"哲学","title":"哲学"},{"count":1,"name":"悲剧研究","title":"悲剧研究"},{"count":1,"name":"悲剧","title":"悲剧"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29634700.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"256","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29634700.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29634700.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29634700.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4509304\/","id":"4509304","publisher":"Routledge","isbn10":"0415191424","isbn13":"9780415191425","title":"Philosophy and Tragedy","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4509304","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Tragedy has always been an important topic in philosophy, ever since Aristotle first wrote about the subject in his \"Poetics\".

The essays demonstrate how the model of tragedy affords the most extreme and thorough presentation of conflicts which are at the heart of continental philosophy, such as the topics of freedom, necessity, identity and historicity and reveal why tragedy is so essential to modern philosophical thinking.","price":"USD 50.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":5,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Basic Overview","author":["Glenn Sparks"],"pubdate":"2012-1-1","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"传播学","title":"传播学"},{"count":1,"name":"Media-research","title":"Media-research"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29752786.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"336","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29752786.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29752786.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29752786.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11609713\/","id":"11609713","publisher":"Wadsworth Publishing","isbn10":"1111344450","isbn13":"9781111344450","title":"Media Effects Research","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/11609713","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"MEDIA EFFECTS RESEARCH, FOURTH EDITION, provides an excellent introduction for students studying mass media's effects on society.

The speed and profundity of these changes are echoed in the rapidly developing character of criminology's subject-matter, whether it is crime rates, crime policy, or the practices of policing, prevention and punishment. The questions that animate this book concern the challenges that are posed for criminology by the economic, cultural, and political transformations that have marked late twentieth-century social life. In this unique collection of essays, a diverse group of distinguished social theorists reflect upon the intellectual challenges and opportunities presented to criminology by recent transformations in the social and intellectual landscapes of contemporary societies. As each essay in its different way reveals, crime and punishment have ceased to be topics that can be contained within the bounds of any specialized discipline. Crime and punishment now play such integral roles in the politics of contemporary societies, are so densely entangled with our daily routines, so deeply lodged in our emotional lives, so vividly represented in our cultural imagination, that they easily escape any analytical box, however capacious, that criminology may develop for their containment. Several of the most persuasive sociological accounts of the present give a prominent place in their analysis to crime, fear of crime, and the calculations of risk and measures of repression to which these give rise. This collection offers a series of powerful and provocative accounts of how crime and its control mesh with the underlying social and political dynamics shaping contemporary society. It raises a series of profound questions about the political and ethical frames through which these problems ought best to be governed.","price":"$ 73.45"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"2012-12","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"图书馆","title":"图书馆"},{"count":1,"name":"lovestory","title":"lovestory"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26290574.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"432","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26290574.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26290574.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26290574.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11532183\/","id":"11532183","publisher":"","isbn10":"1455523542","isbn13":"9781455523542","title":"Safe Haven","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/11532183","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"When a mysterious young woman named Katie appears in the small North Carolina town of Southport, her sudden arrival raises questions about her past.

Icy's adolescence is marred by the humiliation brought on by her mysterious condition, and its all-too-visible symptoms are the source of endless hilarity as everyone around her offers an opinion about what's troubling the girl.

He still adores her - but is his love enough for both of them?","price":"108.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Krause, Jim"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"312","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2821366\/","id":"2821366","publisher":"F & W Pubns Inc","isbn10":"1581804385","isbn13":"9781581804386","title":"Creative Sparks","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2821366","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"0.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Muriel Spark"],"pubdate":"1978-4-27","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"Muriel_Spark","title":"Muriel_Spark"},{"count":1,"name":"英国文学","title":"英国文学"},{"count":1,"name":"现当代","title":"现当代"},{"count":1,"name":"Scotland","title":"Scotland"},{"count":1,"name":"MurielSpark","title":"MurielSpark"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9071774.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s9071774.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s9071774.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9071774.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10725284\/","id":"10725284","publisher":"Penguin","isbn10":"0140019111","isbn13":"9780140019117","title":"The Comforters","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10725284","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 10.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"NicholasSparks","title":"NicholasSparks"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7548645.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7548645.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7548645.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7548645.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10218603\/","id":"10218603","publisher":"","isbn10":"160788822X","isbn13":"9781607888222","title":"True Believer","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10218603","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 62.14"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":3,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"2011-7","tags":[{"count":2,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":2,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"爱情","title":"爱情"},{"count":1,"name":"原版","title":"原版"},{"count":1,"name":"2011","title":"2011"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26628601.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"400","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26628601.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26628601.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26628601.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6847083\/","id":"6847083","publisher":"little brown","isbn10":"0751542997","isbn13":"9780751542998","title":"Safe Haven","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6847083","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Love hurts.

Yet for most of us, fireflies remain shrouded in mystery: How do fireflies make their light? What are they saying with their flashing? And what do fireflies look for in a mate? In Silent Sparks, noted biologist and firefly expert Sara Lewis dives into the fascinating world of fireflies and reveals the most up-to-date discoveries about these beloved insects. From the meadows of New England and the hills of the Great Smoky Mountains, to the rivers of Japan and mangrove forests of Malaysia, this beautifully illustrated and accessible book uncovers the remarkable, dramatic stories of birth, courtship, romance, sex, deceit, poison, and death among fireflies.\nThe nearly two thousand species of fireflies worldwide have evolved in different ways--and while most mate through the aerial language of blinking lights, not all do. Lewis introduces us to fireflies that don't light up at all, relying on wind-borne perfumes to find mates, and we encounter glow-worm fireflies, whose plump, wingless females never fly. We go behind the scenes to meet inquisitive scientists who have dedicated their lives to understanding fireflies, and we learn about various modern threats including light pollution and habitat destruction. In the last section of the book, Lewis provides a field guide for North American fireflies, enabling us to identify them in our own backyards and neighborhoods. This concise, handy guide includes distinguishing features, habits, and range maps for the most commonly encountered fireflies, as well as a gear list.\nA passionate exploration of one of the world's most charismatic and admired insects, Silent Sparks will inspire us to reconnect with the natural world.","price":"USD 29.95"}]}

He analyzes both the changes themselves and their implications for the ways in which we think about the mass media, while also demonstrating that most of the orthodox accounts of the end of communism are seriously flawed. There are much greater continuities between the old system and the new than are captured by the theories that argue that there has been a radical and fundamental change. Instead of marking the end of critical inquiry or the end of history, as some have suggested, Sparks argues that the collapse of the communist systems demonstrates how very limited and frequently incorrect the main ways of discussing the mass media are. He concludes with a provocative discussion of the ways in which we need to modify our thinking in the light of these developments.","price":"USD 125.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"2008-8","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"爱情","title":"爱情"},{"count":1,"name":"2008","title":"2008"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4784470.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4784470.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4784470.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4784470.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4398681\/","id":"4398681","publisher":"","isbn10":"0446698334","isbn13":"9780446698337","title":"The Choice","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4398681","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"#1 New York Times bestseller Nicholas Sparks turns his unrivaled talents to a new tale about love found and lost, and the choices we hope we'll never have to make.\n\n\n Travis Parker has everything a man could want: a good job, loyal friends, even a waterfront home in small-town North Carolina.

Though they were from opposite sides of the tracks, their love for one another seemed to defy the realities of life in the small town of Oriental, North Carolina. But as the summer of their senior year came to a close, unforeseen events would tear the young couple apart, setting them on radically divergent paths.\n\nNow, twenty-five years later, Amanda and Dawson are summoned back to Oriental for the funeral of Tuck Hostetler, the mentor who once gave shelter to their high school romance.

As Amanda and Dawson carry out the instructions Tuck left behind for them, they realize that everything they thought they knew -- about Tuck, about themselves, and about the dreams they held dear -- was not as it seemed.

As she eases herself back into the dating scene, her eye is caught by the darkly sophisticated Richard, as he begins a passionate pursuit of her affections.

In January 2003, Nicholas Sparks and his brother, Micah, set off on a three-week trip around the globe. It was to mark a milestone in their lives, for at thirty-seven and thirty-eight respectively, they were now the only surviving members of their family. \n\nAgainst the backdrop of the wonders of the world and often overtaken by their feelings, daredevil Micah and the more serious, introspective Nicholas recalled their rambunctious childhood adventures and the tragedies that tested their faith. And in the process, they discovered startling truths about loss, love, and hope. Narrated with irrepressible humor and rare candor, THREE WEEKS WITH MY BROTHER reminds us to embrace life with all its uncertainties . . . and most of all, to cherish the joyful times, both small and momentous, and the wonderful people who make them possible.\n\n\n\n With a NOVEL LEARNING SERIES(TM) Student Guide  \n\n -Questions about the text after every few chapters check your comprehension  \n\n -Quizzes throughout help you prepare for standardized tests with SAT- and ACT-style questions using vocabulary and grammar from the book \n\n -Sample writing prompts and essays at the end guide you through the elements of an above-average, average, and below-average essay-and explain why!","price":"$ 16.94"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, David; Sparks, David;"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7540322.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"36","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7540322.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7540322.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7540322.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10478221\/","id":"10478221","publisher":"","isbn10":"1598585878","isbn13":"9781598585872","title":"Flat-Top Sam and the Junkyard Elephant","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10478221","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Almost everyone in town knew Bailey as the \"Junkyard Elephant\" because the Zookeeper would allow Bailey to leave the zoo everyday to spend time at the junkyard performing his stunts. In the junkyard, Bailey could use his imagination, a few selected props and his astounding acrobatic skills to create death-defying stunts. Dexter, who was the owner of the junkyard, loved watching Bailey design and perfect his stunts. When the circus came to town, Bailey, along with many other animals with circus dreams, couldn't wait to show off his amazing acrobatic skills.

Against the backdrop of the wonders of the world and often overtaken by their feelings, daredevil Micah and the more serious, introspective Nicholas recalled their rambunctious childhood adventures and the tragedies that tested their faith. And in the process, they discovered startling truths about loss, love, and hope.Narrated with irrepressible humor and rare candor, and including personal photos, THREE WEEKS WITH MY BROTHER reminds us to embrace life with all its uncertainties...and most of all, to cherish the joyful times, both small and momentous, and the wonderful people who make them possible.","price":"$ 42.94"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Jared"],"pubdate":"2010-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20805298.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"248","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s20805298.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s20805298.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20805298.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/13084491\/","id":"13084491","publisher":"","isbn10":"1141778203","isbn13":"9781141778201","title":"Catalogue of the Library of Jared Sparks","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/13084491","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Jared"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s14804906.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"86","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s14804906.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s14804906.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s14804906.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/13665117\/","id":"13665117","publisher":"","isbn10":"115075849X","isbn13":"9781150758492","title":"Sparks' American Biography","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/13665117","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Bancroft, George;

Drawing upon extensive fieldwork in two contrasting English maximum security prisons, the authors systematically compare their institutional order, including the differing control strategies deployed in each, as seen by both custodians and captives, controllers and controlled. The authors discuss the implications of their research for the tradition of sociological concern within the'prison community'. They re-examine the resources of that rich but latterly somewhat dormant field in the light of some of the main currents in contemporary social theory, and thereby provide a new perspective on the 'problem of order' in maximum custody. This book will have significant policy implications, and it will be required reading for scholars and students in criminology and criminal justice, as well as for administrators and reformers in penal system.","price":"$ 226.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"v. 67","author":["Sparks, Donald L., PH.;

Like the May of Teck Club itself--\"three times window shattered since 1940 but never directly hit\"--its lady inhabitants do their best to act as if the world were back to normal: practicing elocution, and jostling over suitors and a single Schiaparelli gown.

Half-print bottles of milk began to be stood at the doorsteps of houses containing single apartments from Hampstead Heath to Greenwich Park, from Wanstead Flats to Putney Heath; but especially in Hampstead, especially in Kensington\".So begins Muriel Spark's supreme 1960 novel The Bachelors. Our very British bachelors come in every stripe: a barrister, a British councilman, a detective, a very curious \"priest\", a hand-writing expert, a terrifyingly blank spiritual medium, and a guilt-torn good Irish Catholic boy who chews onions to inhibit any success with the opposite sex.Though we first find them contentedly chatting in clubs and shopping at Fortnum's, their cozy bachelor world is not set to stay cozy for long. Soon enough, the men are variously, individually tormented -- defrauded or stolen from; blackmailed or pressed to attend horrid seances -- until, finally, they realize they are about to be plunged, all together, into the nastiest of lawsuits. At the center of that lawsuit, about to face the dock as well as the prospect of unwanted fatherhood, hovers pale Patrick Seton, the medium. Meanwhile, horrors of every size descend upon our poor bachelors -- from the rising price of frozen peas (\"Your hand's never out of your pocket\") to epileptic fits, musings about murder, and spiritualist mouths foaming with protoplasm. And every horror delights: each is limned by Spark's uncanny wit -- at once surreal, malicious, funny, and ultimately serious. The Bachelors presents \"the most gifted and innovative British novelist\" (The New York Times) at her wicked best.","price":"USD 12.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["George Orwell","SparkNotes Editors"],"pubdate":"2002-01-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2658365.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s2658365.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s2658365.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s2658365.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2213261\/","id":"2213261","publisher":"SparkNotes","isbn10":"1586633635","isbn13":"9781586633639","title":"Spark Notes 1984","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2213261","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 5.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Selected Poems, 1980-2002","author":["Sharon Olds"],"pubdate":"2004-9-28","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"english","title":"english"},{"count":1,"name":"Olds,Sharon","title":"Olds,Sharon"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4754323.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4754323.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4754323.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4754323.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2952209\/","id":"2952209","publisher":"Knopf","isbn10":"0375710760","isbn13":"9780375710766","title":"Strike Sparks","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2952209","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"A powerful collection from one of our most gifted and widely read poets-117 of her finest poems drawn from her seven published volumes.\nMichael Ondaatje has called Sharon Olds's poetry \"pure fire in the hands\" and cheered the \"roughness and humor and brag and tenderness and completion in her work as she carries the reader through rooms of passion and loss.\" This rich selection exhibits those qualities in poem after poem, reflecting, moreover, an exciting experimentation with rhythm and language and a movement toward an embrace beyond the personal.

In search of a respite, she agrees to tend a friend's inn for the weekend in the small coastal town of Rodanthe, North Carolina. But a major storm and an unexpected guest bring two wounded people together.\n\n\nSparks (A Bend in the Road, etc.) logs more miles on the winding high road of romance with the story of two middle-aged people who meet by chance in the small North Carolina coastal town of Rodanthe. The impassioned but doomed romance seems to owe much to Robert James Waller's The Bridges of Madison County. Once again, a housewife who has focused on everyone but herself indulges in a brief, intense, secret affair with a stranger who changes her life forever. As the story begins, Adrienne Willis is 60, the divorced mother of three grown children. To help her troubled daughter cope with the untimely recent death of her husband, Adrienne tells her the tale of her love affair, which took place 15 years before. At the time, Adrienne was an uptight matron whose ex-husband had just left her for a younger woman. This rejection colors her entire life, and Sparks realistically portrays a vulnerable and isolated woman who throws herself into raising her children to escape her despair. Paul Flanner, her paramour, is a surgeon and an obsessive workaholic with no genuine connection to his wife or son, whose world completely falls apart when one of his patients inexplicably dies. Sparks builds a taut, plausible relationship between his protagonists, but even fans may be irked by the obviousness of their story and the inevitability of their fate.\n\n\nAdrienne Willis's concern for her widowed daughter prompts her to relate a story she thought would live only in her own heart, a story of love and redemption, loss and grief. JoBeth Williams's tender narration captures the introspection and sadness of Adrienne's tale, as well as its passion. Her detached portrayal of Paul and Adrienne's lives before they find each other conveys all the flatness of their existence, despite the many events filling their days. Williams's characterizations, however, particularly that of the women, would be better if they were not infused with Southern accents. While technically accurate, they sound more stereotypical than real. Soft piano interludes elegantly separate chapters and polish the finished work.

Now, Jeremy is living in the tiny town of Boone Creek, North Carolina, married to Lexie Darnell, the love of his life, and anticipating the birth of their daughter. But just as his life seems to be settling into a blissful pattern, an unsettling and mysterious message re-opens old wounds and sets off a chain of events that will forever change the course of this young couple's marriage.   Dramatic, heartbreaking and surprising, this is a story about the love between a man and a woman and between a parent and a child. More than that, it is a story that beautifully portrays how the same emotion that can break your heart is also the one that will ultimately heal it.  While the novel picks up the tale of Lexie Darnell and Jeremy Marsh that started in  True Believer  and will delight fans of that novel, it stands on its own as one of Nicholas Sparks's most deeply moving love stories.","price":"$ 40.68"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Muriel Spark"],"pubdate":"1998-5-22","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"Muriel_Spark","title":"Muriel_Spark"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24512519.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"160","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s24512519.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s24512519.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24512519.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2675816\/","id":"2675816","publisher":"Mariner Books","isbn10":"0395901332","isbn13":"9780395901335","title":"Reality and Dreams","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2675816","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 12.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Kandampully, Jay (EDT)\/ Mok, Connie (EDT)\/ Sparks, Beverley A.

She came to Edenton in an attempt to make ends meet while devoting herself to the care of her child. Falling in love was the last thing she intended.\n\nA near fatal car crash brings Denise and Taylor together, and awakens in them felings long dormant. But before Taylor can fully welcome Denise and Kyle into his life, he must first take the ultimate risk-to look into his heart and his past, and see if it's not too late to take a chance on the future.\n\n\n From the Hardcover edition.","price":"CDN$ 26.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicolas Sparks"],"pubdate":"2006","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3383116.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3383116.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3383116.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3383116.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3317659\/","id":"3317659","publisher":"","isbn10":"8876849750","isbn13":"9788876849756","title":"Ricordati Di Guardare La Luna","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3317659","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"1998-04-30","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"英文","title":"英文"},{"count":1,"name":"美国","title":"美国"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4508743.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4508743.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4508743.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4508743.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2645059\/","id":"2645059","publisher":"Little, Brown and Company","isbn10":"0446523569","isbn13":"9780446523561","title":"Message in a Bottle","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2645059","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Divorced and disillusioned about relationships, Theresa Osborne is jogging when she finds a bottle on the beach.

When a raging storm hits his small Southern town, single mother Denise Holton's car skids off the road. The young mom is with her four-year-old son, Kyle, a boy with severe learning disabilities and for whom she has sacrificed everything.

During the search for Kyle, the connection between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn't know that this rescue will be different from all the others, demanding far more than raw physical courage. It will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love and will require him to open doors to his past that were slammed shut by pain.

How do, and how should, its practitioners engage with politics and public policy? How can criminology find a voice in an agitated, insecure and intensely mediated world in which crime and punishment loom large in government agendas and public discourse? What collective good do we want criminological enquiry to promote? In addressing these questions, Ian Loader and Richard Sparks offer a sociological account of how criminologists understand their craft and position themselves in relation to social and political controversies about crime, whether as scientific experts, policy advisors, governmental players, social movement theorists, or lonely prophets. They examine the conditions under which these diverse commitments and affiliations arose, and gained or lost credibility and influence. This forms the basis for a timely articulation of the idea that criminology's overarching public purpose is to contribute to a better politics of crime and its regulation. \"Public Criminology?\" offers an original and provocative account of the condition of, and prospects for, criminology which will be of interest not only to those who work in the fields of crime, security and punishment, but to anyone interested in the vexed relationship between social science, public policy and politics.","price":"$ 59.83"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Spark, Muriel"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8688823.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8688823.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8688823.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8688823.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7120870\/","id":"7120870","publisher":"","isbn10":"1433206137","isbn13":"9781433206139","title":"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7120870","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 28.19"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Muriel Spark"],"pubdate":"1975-10-30","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"英文","title":"英文"},{"count":1,"name":"Scotland","title":"Scotland"},{"count":1,"name":"Muriel_Spark","title":"Muriel_Spark"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9063302.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"128","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s9063302.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s9063302.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9063302.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10605695\/","id":"10605695","publisher":"Penguin","isbn10":"0140031316","isbn13":"9780140031317","title":"The Public Image","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10605695","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 8.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Spark, Muriel"],"pubdate":"2011-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10451503.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"224","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s10451503.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s10451503.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10451503.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10833680\/","id":"10833680","publisher":"","isbn10":"0811219232","isbn13":"9780811219235","title":"Curriculum Vitae","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10833680","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Muriel Spark’s bracingly salty memoir is a no-holds-barred trip through an extraordinary writer’s life.

Born to a Scottish Jewish father and an English Presbyterian mother, Spark describes her childhood in 1930s Edinburgh in brief, dazzling anecdotes. In one she recalls a cherished schoolteacher, Christina Kay, who would later be used as the prototype for Miss Jean Brodie. Spark boldly details her disastrous first marriage to Sydney Oswald Spark (S.O.S.) — himself thirty-two, she just nineteen — whom she followed to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and left behind to return to England. In the midst of WWII, Spark took a bizarre position working in the disinformation campaign of the British Secret Service, eliciting information from German POWs to combat Nazi propaganda. She later moved to the Poetry Society of London, where she mingled with literati and other intellectuals, befriended by some (such as Graham Greene, an early supporter of her work) and sparring with others.

He has spent too little time at home and too much at the office, leaving the responsibility of raising their children to Jane. Now his daughter is about to marry, and his wife is thinking about leaving him. But if Wilson is sure of anything, it is this: His love for Jane has only grown over the years, and he will do everything he can to save their marriage. With the memories of Noah and Allie's inspiring life together as his guide, he vows to find a way to make his wife fall in love with him...all over again. In this powerfully moving tale of love lost, rediscovered, and renewed, Nicholas Sparks once again brings readers his unique insight into the only emotion that ultimately really matters.","price":"252.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Last Song","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"2010-8","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"尼古拉斯·斯帕克思","title":"尼古拉斯·斯帕克思"},{"count":1,"name":"小说","title":"小说"},{"count":1,"name":"外国文学","title":"外国文学"},{"count":1,"name":"2010","title":"2010"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6930937.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6930937.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6930937.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6930937.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5480145\/","id":"5480145","publisher":"","isbn10":"1607882531","isbn13":"9781607882534","title":"The Last Song","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5480145","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"#1 bestselling author Nicholas Sparks's new novel is at once a compelling family drama and a heartrending tale of young love.        Seventeen year old Veronica \"Ronnie\" Miller's life was turned upside-down when her parents divorced and her father moved from New York City to Wilmington, North Carolina. Three years later, she remains angry and alientated from her parents, especially her father...until her mother decides it would be in everyone's best interest if she spent the summer in Wilmington with him. Ronnie's father, a former concert pianist and teacher, is living a quiet life in the beach town, immersed in creating a work of art that will become the centerpiece of a local church.       The tale that unfolds is an unforgettable story of love on many levels -- first love, love between parents and children -- that demonstrates, as only a Nicholas Sparks novel can, the many ways that love can break our hearts...and heal them.","price":"$ 16.93"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Spermatic Knowledge v. 1","author":["Henri Atlan"],"pubdate":"2010-11-15","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8059536.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":["Lenn J.

Many commentators have seen stories like this, and TV shows like Jerry Springer's, as evidence of a decline in the standards of the mass media. This increasing interest in private lives and the falling off of coverage of serious news is often described as \"tabloidization.\" The essays in this book are the first serious scholarly studies of what is going on and what its implications are. Reality, it turns out, is much more complex than some of the laments suggest. As the contributors show, this is not just a U.S. problem but is repeated in country after country, and it is not certain that the media anywhere are getting more tabloid. What is more, there is no consensus about whether tabloidization is just \"dumbing down\" or whether it is a necessary tactic for the mass media to engage with new audiences who do not have the news habit. Tabloid Tales will be of interest to students and scholars in journalism, mass communication, political science, and cultural and media studies.","price":"USD 121.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Volume 2: The Atheism of Scripture","author":["Henri Atlan"],"pubdate":"2013-1-15","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s23002639.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":["Lenn J.

The survey and analysis are guided by a critical discussion of concepts of journalistic professionalism and the role played by education and training in developing such ideas. The book explores the origins and motivations of students, and the ambitions they have as future journalists. The students had three different concepts of the role of the press: the enlightenment model in which the prime functions is to educate and inform; the power model, ensuring the views of socially powerful groups are publicized; and the entertainment model, which provides the audience with distractions. With a strong desire for professional status, they believe that the form of media ownership dominant in their own society is a major threat to press freedom.","price":"USD 49.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":2,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Muriel Spark"],"pubdate":"2009-11-5","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"Muriel.Spark","title":"Muriel.Spark"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4283191.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4283191.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4283191.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4283191.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4763359\/","id":"4763359","publisher":"Virago","isbn10":"1844085511","isbn13":"9781844085514","title":"A Far Cry From Kensington","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4763359","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"When Mrs Hawkins tells Hector Bartlett he is a 'pisseur de copie', that he 'urinates frightful prose', little does she realise the repercussions.

They’re fools and madmen and like the art of war. And their children go hungry while we piss gold and jewels into the dust.\nIn the richest empire the world has ever known, the city of Sorlost has always stood, eternal and unconquered. But in a city of dreams governed by an imposturous Emperor, decadence has become the true ruler, and has blinded its inhabitants to their vulnerability. The empire is on the verge of invasion – and only one man can see it.\nHaunted by dreams of the empire’s demise, Orhan Emmereth has decided to act. On his orders, a company of soldiers cross the desert to reach the city. Once they enter the Palace, they have one mission: kill the Emperor, then all those who remain. Only from ashes can a new empire be built.\nThe company is a group of good, ordinary soldiers, for whom this is a mission like any other. But the strange boy Marith who walks among them is no ordinary soldier. Marching on Sorlost, Marith thinks he is running away from the past which haunts him. But in the Golden City, his destiny awaits him – beautiful, bloody, and more terrible than anyone could have foreseen.","ebook_price":"83.06","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Plant,

It retells the story of the behind-the-scenes collaborations that started with a meeting between Kobie Coetsee, then Minister of Justice, and Nelson Mandela in 1985. By 1986, negotiations involved senior government officials, intelligence agents and the African National Congress. For the next four years, they assembled in places such as a gamepark lodge, the Palace Hotel in Lucerne, Switzerland, a fishing hideaway and even in a hospital room. All the while, De Klerk's campaign assured white constituents nothing would change. Sparks shows how the key players, who began with little reason to trust one another, developed friendships which would later play a crucial role in South Africa's struggle to end apartheid. Allister Sparks's \"The Mind of South Africa\" won South Africa's 1990 Sanlam Literary Award.

Most managers assume that gifted individuals -- readily identifiable \"creative types\" -- offer the quickest route to out-of-the-box, breakthrough thinking, and if you don't have an eccentric genius on your team, your group is doomed to mediocrity. Yet, say Dorothy Leonard and Walter Swap. most innovations today spring from well-led group interactions. In \"When Sparks Fly, \" the authors sweep aside the conventional thinking about creativity to reveal that any group -- if designed and managed effectively -- can produce more innovative services, products, and processes. Unlike most books on creativity, \"When Sparks Fly\" focuses on the process as it applies to groups of people who may not fit the stereotype of right-brained \"creatives.\" Leonard and Swap offer managers proven strategies for generating the group dynamics that lie at the heart of innovative thinking, including specific techniques for re-channeling the tensions of conflicting points of view into new ideas and alternative options. They show how forward-looking companies such as Fisher Price, Intel, and Hewlett-Packard use group situations to maximize their creative potential. \"When Sparks Fly\" explores how all aspects of the work environment, from leadership style to the use of space, sound, even smell, can enhance innovation. It will help managers motivate and lead groups of people in ways that ignite their full creative potential.","price":"$ 39.55"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3520913.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"322","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3520913.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3520913.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3520913.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2040179\/","id":"2040179","publisher":"Grand Central Pub","isbn10":"0446532436","isbn13":"9780446532433","title":"真实信仰者","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2040179","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author comes an unforgettable love story that explores the deepest mysteries of all those of the heart.

These stories are eerie and sometimes a little perverse, always delightful, and as rich as her acclaimed novels. Open to the Public contains thirty-seven marvelous stories, ten of which have never before been published in the US. These stories offer a bouquet of unexpected protagonists-faded aristocrats and ghosts, cleaning women and blithe murderers, sinister children and a lecherous hanging judge, and even a dragon. The settings of Open to the Public swing from England to contemporary Italy, postwar Africa, the French countryside, an Austrian village, and then back to the Portobello Road. Spark reorders reality in odd ways; she probes beneath the veneer of social respectability to finger undercurrents of madness-at the beginning of one of her tales, one can never guess its end.

The discovery of neurotransmitters revolutionized the way we think about the brain and what it means to be human yet few people know how they were discovered, the scientists involved, or the fierce controversy about whether they even existed.  The War of the Soups and the Sparks tells the saga of the dispute between the pharmacologists, who had uncovered the first evidence that nerves communicate by releasing chemicals, and the neurophysiologists, experts on the nervous system, who dismissed the evidence and remained committed to electrical explanations.  The protagonists of this story are Otto Loewi and Henry Dale, who received Nobel Prizes for their work, and Walter Cannon, who would have shared the prize with them if he had not been persuaded to adopt a controversial theory (how that happened is an important part of this history). Valenstein sets his story of scientific discovery against the backdrop of two world wars and examines the fascinating lives of several scientists whose work was affected by the social and political events of their time. He recounts such stories as Loewi's arrest by Nazi storm troopers and Dale's efforts at helping key scientists escape Germany. The War of the Soups and the Sparks reveals how science and scientists work. Valenstein describes the observations and experiments that led to the discovery of neurotransmitters and sheds light on what determines whether a novel concept will gain acceptance among the scientific community. His work also explains the immense importance of Loewi, Dale, and Cannon's achievements in our understanding of the human brain and the way mental illnesses are conceptualized and treated.","price":"$ 96.05"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Kerrelyn Sparks"],"pubdate":"2006-05-01","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"原文书","title":"原文书"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3872409.jpg","binding":"Mass Market Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"387","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s3872409.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s3872409.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s3872409.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2662959\/","id":"2662959","publisher":"Avon","isbn10":"0060752017","isbn13":"9780060752019","title":"Vamps and the City (Love at Stake, Book 2)","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2662959","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Who says a vamp can't have it all?

And no one can throw a party quite like Jack, the illegitimate son of the legendary Casanova.

The tale that unfolds is an unforgettable story about love in its myriad forms - first love, the love between parents and children - that demonstrates, as only a Nicholas Sparks novel can, the many ways that deeply felt relationships can break our hearts ...and heal them.","price":"108.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Anonymous; Sparks, Beatrice;"],"pubdate":"2010-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5543020.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5543020.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5543020.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5543020.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5318070\/","id":"5318070","publisher":"","isbn10":"1442423102","isbn13":"9781442423107","title":"Go Ask Alice\/Jay's Journal","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5318070","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"123.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"2010-1-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5589203.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"335","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5589203.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5589203.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5589203.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5985519\/","id":"5985519","publisher":"Perfection Learning","isbn10":"1606863622","isbn13":"9781606863626","title":"Dear John","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5985519","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 17.45"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"原版","title":"原版"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5947667\/","id":"5947667","publisher":"","isbn10":"1417663936","isbn13":"9781417663934","title":"A Bend in the Road","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5947667","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"143.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8438317.jpg","binding":"","translator":["Rabascall, Iolanda"],"catalog":"","pages":"299","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8438317.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8438317.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8438317.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5943989\/","id":"5943989","publisher":"","isbn10":"8499181945","isbn13":"9788499181943","title":"En Nombre del Amor = In the Name of Love","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5943989","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 25.93"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Jon"],"pubdate":"2010-2","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"海淀图书馆","title":"海淀图书馆"},{"count":1,"name":"摄影","title":"摄影"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6623124.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"240","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6623124.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6623124.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6623124.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5925158\/","id":"5925158","publisher":"","isbn10":"1906672687","isbn13":"9781906672683","title":"Nikon D300s","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5925158","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This is the perfect reference to help maximize the potential of Nikon D300s, a lightweight camera with professional capabilities.

She'd believed in it once, too, back when she was eighteen.\" \n\nIn the spring of 1984, high school students Amanda Collier and Dawson Cole fell deeply, irrevocably in love. Though they were from opposite sides of the tracks, their love for one another seemed to defy the realities of life in the small town of Oriental, North Carolina. But as the summer of their senior year came to a close, unforeseen events would tear the young couple apart, setting them on radically divergent paths.\n\nNow, twenty-five years later, Amanda and Dawson are summoned back to Oriental for the funeral of Tuck Hostetler, the mentor who once gave shelter to their high school romance. Neither has lived the life they imagined . . . and neither can forget the passionate first love that forever changed their lives. As Amanda and Dawson carry out the instructions Tuck left behind for them, they realize that everything they thought they knew -- about Tuck, about themselves, and about the dreams they held dear -- was not as it seemed. Forced to confront painful memories, the two former lovers will discover undeniable truths about the choices they have made. And in the course of a single, searing weekend, they will ask of the living, and the dead:  Can love truly rewrite the past?","price":"CDN$ 38.98"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Nicholas Sparks"],"pubdate":"2011-1","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"2011","title":"2011"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8710641.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"292","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8710641.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8710641.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8710641.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6836133\/","id":"6836133","publisher":"","isbn10":"1455502537","isbn13":"9781455502530","title":"The Best of Me","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6836133","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"138.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["David Sparks"],"pubdate":"2011-10-4","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6901853.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"368","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6901853.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6901853.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6901853.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6804644\/","id":"6804644","publisher":"Wiley","isbn10":"1118100565","isbn13":"9781118100561","title":"iPad at Work","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6804644","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Great ideas and advice on using your iPad as a business tool!

It explores the perils of personal and political infatuation among schoolgirls and their teachers. Salvation is the theme of The Girls Of Slender Means, which vividly evokes the life of postwar London. The Driver's Seat, made into a film starring Elizabeth Taylor, charts the heroine's descent into madness. The Only Problem is a witty fable about suffering, which brings the Book of Job to bear on contemporary terrorism.","price":"152.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"2012-4","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"2012","title":"2012"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26628800.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"334","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26628800.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26628800.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26628800.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7066118\/","id":"7066118","publisher":"little brown","isbn10":"0751543438","isbn13":"9780751543438","title":"The Lucky One","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7066118","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Is there really such a thing as a good luck charm?

me just as I see you . . .\nColin Hancock is giving his second chance his best shot. With a history of violence and bad decisions behind him and the threat of prison dogging his every step, he's determined to walk a straight line. To Colin, that means applying himself single-mindedly toward his teaching degree and avoiding everything that proved destructive in his earlier life. Reminding himself daily of his hard-earned lessons, the last thing he is looking for is a serious relationship.\nMaria Sanchez, the hardworking daughter of Mexican immigrants, is the picture of conventional success. With a degree from Duke Law School and a job at a prestigious firm in Wilmington, she is a dark-haired beauty with a seemingly flawless professional track record. And yet Maria has a traumatic history of her own, one that compelled her to return to her hometown and left her questioning so much of what she once believed.\nA chance encounter on a rain-swept road will alter the course of both Colin and Maria's lives, challenging deeply held assumptions about each other and ultimately, themselves. As love unexpectedly takes hold between them, they dare to envision what a future together could possibly look like . . . until menacing reminders of events in Maria's past begin to surface.\nAs a series of threatening incidents wreaks chaos in Maria's life, Maria and Colin will be tested in increasingly terrifying ways. Will demons from their past destroy the tenuous relationship they've begun to build, or will their love protect them, even in the darkest hour?\nRich in emotion and fueled with suspense, SEE ME reminds us that love is sometimes forged in the crises that threaten to shatter us . . . and that those who see us for who we truly are may not always be the ones easiest to recognize.","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A HISTOMAP of PEOPLES and NATIONS for 4,000 YEARS","author":["John B.

These animals have the ability to shock potential prey or would-be predators with high-powered electrical discharges.\nWilliam J. Turkel asks completely fresh questions about the evolutionary, environmental, and historical aspects of people’s interest in electric fish. Stimulated by painful encounters with electric catfish, torpedos, and electric eels, people learned to harness the power of electric shock for medical therapies and eventually developed technologies to store, transmit, and control electricity. Now we look to these fish as an inspiration for engineering new sensors, computer interfaces, autonomous undersea robots, and energy-efficient batteries.","series":{"id":"26612","title":"Animal, History, Culture"},"price":"USD 34.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"2013-12-17","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"图书馆","title":"图书馆"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29095145.jpg","binding":"简装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"432","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29095145.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29095145.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29095145.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/24808061\/","id":"24808061","publisher":"Grand Central Publishing","isbn10":"1455574066","isbn13":"9781455574063","title":"A Bend in the Road","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/24808061","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Cambridge Bright Sparks","author":["Andrew Plant"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28395247.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s28395247.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s28395247.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s28395247.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/26719730\/","id":"26719730","publisher":"","isbn10":"0521146429","isbn13":"9780521146425","title":"Looking For Mum","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/26719730","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Muriel Spark"],"pubdate":"1984-2-7","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"Muriel_Spark","title":"Muriel_Spark"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24523453.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"240","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s24523453.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s24523453.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24523453.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/20471764\/","id":"20471764","publisher":"Perigee Trade","isbn10":"0399509305","isbn13":"9780399509308","title":"Territorial Rights","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/20471764","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 6.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Play","author":["Muriel Spark"],"pubdate":"1963-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24523458.jpg","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"116","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s24523458.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s24523458.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24523458.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/20471769\/","id":"20471769","publisher":"Macmillan","isbn10":"0333029852","isbn13":"9780333029855","title":"Doctors of Philosophy","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/20471769","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP .90"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Nicholas"],"pubdate":"2013-6","tags":[{"count":3,"name":"★","title":"★"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26086801.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"368","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26086801.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26086801.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26086801.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/20895864\/","id":"20895864","publisher":"","isbn10":"1455545384","isbn13":"9781455545384","title":"At First Sight","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/20895864","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"There are a few things Jeremy Marsh was sure he'd never do: he'd never leave New York City; never give his heart away again after barely surviving one failed marriage; and, most of all, never become a parent.

Basic principles governing riser behavior are presented and justified clearly. The primary parameters that influence riser behavior are identified and their influence illustrated using Excel spreadsheets provided on an accompanying CD-ROM. Readers will also be able to use these files with their own data. The spreadsheets are designed firstly to illustrate and confirm affirmations made in the text, but readers will also be able to use them to carry out their own simplified analyses.

But something keeps bringing him back to life, and now there is nothing stopping him from taking back the throne that is rightfully his.\nThalia, the former high priestess, remains Marith's only tenuous grasp to whatever goodness he has left. His left hand and his last source of light, Thalia still believes that the power that lies within him can be used for better ends. But as more forces gather beneath Marith's banner, she can feel her influence slipping.\nRead the second book in this \"gritty and glorious!\" (Miles Cameron) epic fantasy series reminiscent of Joe Abercrombie and Mark Lawrence where the exiled son of a king fights to reclaim his throne no matter the cost.\nEmpires of Dust\nThe Court of Broken Knives\nThe Tower of Living and Dying","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A Revolutionary Way to Improve Effectiveness Through Client-Directed, Outcome-Informed Therapy","author":["Barry L.

Instead, they advocate for the long-ignored but most crucial factor in therapeutic success-the innate resources of the client. Based on extensive clinical research and case studies,  The Heroic Client  not only shows how to harness the client's powers of regeneration to make therapy effective, but also how to enlist the client as a partner to make therapy accountable.  The Heroic Client  inspires therapists to boldly rewrite the drama of therapy, recast clients in their rightful role as heroes and heroines of the therapeutic stage, and legitimize their services to third-party payers without the compromises of the medical model.","price":"GBP 32.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Kane, Frank"],"pubdate":"2017-6-30","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"计算机","title":"计算机"},{"count":1,"name":"Spark","title":"Spark"},{"count":1,"name":"Python","title":"Python"},{"count":1,"name":"Data","title":"Data"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29752303.jpg","binding":"平装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"296","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s29752303.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s29752303.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s29752303.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/27087413\/","id":"27087413","publisher":"Packt Publishing Limited","isbn10":"1787287947","isbn13":"9781787287945","title":"Frank Kane's Taming Big Data with Apache Spark and Python","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/27087413","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Star Wars","author":["Charles Soule","Angel Unzueta"],"pubdate":"2018-12-4","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33538691.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"176","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s33538691.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s33538691.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33538691.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/30301482\/","id":"30301482","publisher":"Marvel - US","isbn10":"1302911708","isbn13":"9781302911706","title":"Poe Dameron Vol. 5 - The Spark and The Fire","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/30301482","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"GBP 14.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":1,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Muriel Spark"],"pubdate":"1994-9-17","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4369265.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"204","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4369265.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4369265.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4369265.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2690855\/","id":"2690855","publisher":"New Directions","isbn10":"0811212858","isbn13":"9780811212854","title":"The Comforters","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2690855","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In Muriel Spark's fantastic first novel, the only things that aren't ambiguous are her matchless originality and glittering wit.

When he’s buried alive in the aftermath of his first real tempest, the young mage’s life is about to end before it can truly begin—until it doesn’t. In a flash, a power he didn’t know he had whisks him away from his home, to a world of stone, glass, and wonder: Ravnica. Teyo is a Planeswalker, one of many to be called to the world-spanning city—all lured by Nicol Bolas, the Elder Dragon. Bolas lays siege to the city of Ravnica, hungry for the ultimate prize: godhood itself. His unparalleled magic and unstoppable army appear poised to bring the city to utter ruin.\nAmong those who stand in the way of Bolas’s terrifying machinations are the Gatewatch, Planeswalkers sworn to defeat evil, no matter where it’s found. But as they work to unite the other mages and mount a defense of the city and its people, the terrifying truth of Bolas’s plan becomes clear. The Elder Dragon has prepared a trap to ensnare the most powerful mages from across the Multiverse—and it’s too late to escape.\nAs forces great and small converge on the city and the battle rages, the stakes could not be higher. If the Gatewatch falters and the Planeswalkers fail, the curtain will fall on the age of heroes—and rise on the infinite reign of Nicol Bolas.","price":"USD 16.20"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Learning to Understand Text at Scale","author":["Alex Thomas"],"pubdate":"2020-2-21","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"软件工程","title":"软件工程"},{"count":1,"name":"计算机科学","title":"计算机科学"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33451831.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"350","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s33451831.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s33451831.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s33451831.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/34786865\/","id":"34786865","publisher":"O'Reilly Media","isbn10":"1492047694","isbn13":"9781492047698","title":"Natural Language Processing with Spark NLP","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/34786865","alt_title":"","author_intro":"Alex is a Senior Software Engineer, working on natural language processing components, and data science projects at Atigeo.

She also suddenly finds herself entertaining romantic thoughts about Mike Harris, her best friend in the world. Mike is nowhere near as debonair as Richard and has permanent grease stains on his hands from his work as an auto mechanic, but he's funny, loyal, and a great favourite with Julie's beloved dog Singer. When Julie innocently chooses between the two men, she has no idea that she will set off a chain of events at once terrifying, dangerous and, ultimately, deadly. A riveting tale of love, jealousy and obsession, THE GUARDIAN has all the romance that Nicholas Sparks' fans have come to expect as well as a new element of suspense that will keep them turning the pages late into the night.","price":"68.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Inside the New South Africa","author":["Allister Sparks"],"pubdate":"2009-06-01","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4297784.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"370","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4297784.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4297784.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4297784.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2433487\/","id":"2433487","publisher":"University Of Chicago Press","isbn10":"0226768597","isbn13":"9780226768595","title":"Beyond the Miracle","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2433487","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"USD 20.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Cheyette, Bryan"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s12458198.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"128","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s12458198.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s12458198.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s12458198.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2475532\/","id":"2475532","publisher":"Univ Pr of Mississippi","isbn10":"0746309074","isbn13":"9780746309070","title":"Muriel Spark","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2475532","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"21"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Arceneaux, William"],"pubdate":"2004-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8060718.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"384","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8060718.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8060718.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8060718.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2441761\/","id":"2441761","publisher":"Louisiana State Univ Pr","isbn10":"0807130257","isbn13":"9780807130254","title":"No Spark of Malice","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2441761","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"On April 22, 1896, Martin Begnaud was brutally murdered in his general store in Scott Station, Louisiana.

The fact of loss, the fact of desire, and all the wild, unruly facts of history hammer down and sparks fly up. This, then, is a collection of facts. In a rushing, rolling style, poems sweep to the edge of falling apart, take great delight in defying that dissolution, and come upon a thing redemptive and clarifying: the fact of love. In a world that \"doesn't really care \/ whether we live or die,\" Steve Scafidi writes, \"tell it you do and why.\" Against the harrowing fact of death, Scafidi celebrates dream and desire and the sweet erotics of springtime. Witnessing the budding of muscle trees, the nakedness of a lover, and the furious plowing of a river in the month of April amounts to a sensual equivalent of hope. And yet, the facts of history - from Troy to Rome to Montgomery, Alabama - arouse a great dread of our own cruelties. The truth of the South, the poems show, is often a brutal mix of ignorance and force that America learned from the great classical civilizations. From the unthinkable to the quietly heroic, somehow we have emerged. Sparks from a Nine-Pound Hammer celebrates that fact most of all.","price":"$ 19.15"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Duran, Roberto Tinoco"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"124","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2952908\/","id":"2952908","publisher":"Booksurge Llc","isbn10":"1419641115","isbn13":"9781419641114","title":"Dark Spark","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2952908","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"12.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Spark, Arlene"],"pubdate":"2007-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s13023558.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"576","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s13023558.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s13023558.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s13023558.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2490214\/","id":"2490214","publisher":"CRC Pr I Llc","isbn10":"0849314739","isbn13":"9780849314735","title":"Nutrition in Public Health","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2490214","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Nutrition plays a key role in many areas of public health such as pre-term delivery, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular and renal diseases. Government nutrition policy, therefore, bears a huge influence on the nation's biggest health concerns. There is a clear need for information on this topic that unarguably holds the key to the primary and secondary prevention of some of the major causes of premature death in the US. \"Nutrition in Public Health: Principles, Policies, and Practice\" provides an overview of the field and focuses on the role of the Federal Government in determining nutrition policy and practice. Beginning with a review of the definition and principles of public health, the book examines trends in the US population and nutritional epidemiology. It considers programs to help reduce disparities in the prevalence of diet-related chronic diseases among various populations, as well as a detailed chapter on obesity with discussions on global impact and cost, pediatric obesity, and the impact of socioeconomic status and ethnicity. Specific information is included on breastfeeding mothers, HIV\/AIDS, and prison inmates. The book offers a look at the current nutritional status and guidelines in the US before providing a set of tools for the responsible practice of public health nutrition such as conducting nutrition assessments, designing and carrying out social marketing campaigns, writing grant proposals, and enacting programs to promote food security and ensure food supply and safety.

The discovery of neurotransmitters revolutionized the way we think about the brain and what it means to be human yet few people know how they were discovered, the scientists involved, or the fierce controversy about whether they even existed.  The War of the Soups and the Sparks tells the saga of the dispute between the pharmacologists, who had uncovered the first evidence that nerves communicate by releasing chemicals, and the neurophysiologists, experts on the nervous system, who dismissed the evidence and remained committed to electrical explanations.  The protagonists of this story are Otto Loewi and Henry Dale, who received Nobel Prizes for their work, and Walter Cannon, who would have shared the prize with them if he had not been persuaded to adopt a controversial theory (how that happened is an important part of this history). Valenstein sets his story of scientific discovery against the backdrop of two world wars and examines the fascinating lives of several scientists whose work was affected by the social and political events of their time. He recounts such stories as Loewi's arrest by Nazi storm troopers and Dale's efforts at helping key scientists escape Germany. The War of the Soups and the Sparks reveals how science and scientists work. Valenstein describes the observations and experiments that led to the discovery of neurotransmitters and sheds light on what determines whether a novel concept will gain acceptance among the scientific community. His work also explains the immense importance of Loewi, Dale, and Cannon's achievements in our understanding of the human brain and the way mental illnesses are conceptualized and treated.","price":"$ 31.64"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Ralph, Sheila Sparks\/ Taylor, Cynthia M."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"758","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2494710\/","id":"2494710","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","isbn10":"1582552924","isbn13":"9781582552927","title":"Nursing Diagnosis Reference Manual","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2494710","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"48.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Sheila M.\/ Taylor, Cynthia M."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"352","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2485370\/","id":"2485370","publisher":"Lippincott Williams & Wilkins","isbn10":"1582552185","isbn13":"9781582552187","title":"Nursing Diagnosis Cards","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2485370","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"34.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Donald L.

Specifically, Close studies the photographic practice of four, turn-of-the-twentieth-century women photographers: Mattie Gunterman (1872-1945), Geraldine Moodie (1854-1945), Ruby Gordon Peterkin (1887-1961), and Etta Sparks (1879-1917). From a revisionist point of view, it argues that photography is a social practice used by women professionals and amateurs as a vehicle to explore and establish identity. \"Framing Identity\" defines photography as social practice and examines how women moved beyond making pictorial images to using photography as a form of speech to represent social issues. Key concepts and practices drawn from cultural analysis and issues related to identity, gender, post-colonialism, tourism and travel are mapped out. Close considers Guntermanas photographs as a form of visual narrative within the context of the family album and the practice of amateur, women photographers.

Queering Creole Spiritual Traditions: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Participation in African-Inspired Traditions in the Americas is a groundbreaking scholarly exploration of this long-neglected subject. It offers clear insight into the complex dynamics of gender and sexual orientation, humans and deities, and race and ethnicity, within these richly nuanced spiritual practices.   \n\nQueering Creole Spiritual Traditions explores the ways in which gender complexity and same-sex intimacy are integral to the primary beliefs and practices of these faiths. It begins with a comprehensive overview of Vodou, Santeria, and other African-based religions. The second section includes extensive, revealing interviews with practitioners who offer insight into the intersection of their beliefs, their sexual orientation, and their gender identity. Finally, it provides a powerful analysis of the ways these traditions have inspired artists, musicians, and writers such as Audre Lorde, as well as informative interviews with the artists themselves.   \n\nIn Queering Creole Spiritual Traditions, you will discover:   how the presence of androgynous divinities affects both faith and practice in Vodou, Candomble, Santeria, and other Creole religions   \n\nhow the phenomenon of possession or embodiment by a god or goddess may validate queer identity and nurture gender complexity   \n\nwho practices the African-derived spiritual traditions, what they believe, and who their deities are   \n\nhow these faiths have influenced the art and aesthetic traditions of the West   \n\nThis landmark book opens a fascinating new world of thought and belief. The authors provide rigorous documentation and faultless scholarly method as well as personal experience and the testimony of believers. Queering Creole Spiritual Traditions sheds new light on two widely different fields: LGBT studies and the theology of the African diaspora. A thorough bibliography points the way to further study, and an extensive photograph gallery provides a unique look at the believers and their practices. Every library with holdings in queer theory, African mythology, or sociology of religion should have this landmark volume.","price":"USD 29.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Garry Egger\\Ross Spark\\James Lawson\\Rob Donovan"],"pubdate":"1999-10-01","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"\n      ","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1696903\/","id":"1696903","publisher":"McGraw-Hill Professional","isbn10":"0074704834","isbn13":"9780074704837","title":"Health Promotion Strategies and Methods","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1696903","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"\n      ","price":"285.5"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["杰奎琳·威尔逊"],"pubdate":"2005-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9028071.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"192","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s9028071.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s9028071.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9028071.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/1348747\/","id":"1348747","publisher":"PENGUIN U.K.","isbn10":"0141319496","isbn13":"9780141319490","title":"Video Rose and Mark Spark","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/1348747","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"本书集两本好书合于一体，绝对超值！《录像狂露丝》（Video Rose）——露丝喜欢看录像，每天坐在电视机前，所以，放映机坏掉的消息对她来说真是个大噩梦！不过来了一位神秘的修理工，他给予露丝把生活快进或回放的超能力，于是露丝得以看到在电视机前度过的一生……《黑暗中的马克•斯帕克》（Mark Spark in the Dark）——所有人都认为马克是全校最勇敢的孩子，其实他有一个说不出口的秘密，那就是怕黑。一个漆黑的夜晚，奶奶遇到了麻烦，只有马克才能帮助她。这时马克才发现，危机关头，为了自己爱的人，黑暗不再可怕！\n\nTwo brilliant books in one!

The second-grade teacher of his son, Jonah, Sarah had left Baltimore after a difficult divorce to start over in the gentler surroundings of New Bern. Perhaps it is her own emotional wounds that make her sensitive to the hurt she sees first in Jonah's eyes and then in his father's. Tentatively, Sarah and Miles reach out to each other.

Anna Leslie's pyrotechnic creations might light up the skies on the Fourth of July, but her research and development skills are not lighting up her private nights. Her hard-working, good-girl approach to life isn't doing much for her outside the bedroom, either. When an ultimatum from her boss pushes her out of her lab, Anna decides it's time to let loose and start creating fireworks of a more personal nature. Jay Whitman can't believe the fiery bombshell in red is Frontier Fireworks' resident genius. He's convinced that her passion for rockets disguises a very earthy passion for the phallic, forget the symbol. To encourage her in a new line of research, he volunteers to give his body to science. It's an offer she can't refuse, but Anna quickly realizes this is one experiment that can't be controlled or predicted. They're caught up in an attraction that defies all the laws of chemistry and physics, and she discovers that falling in love isn't rocket science-it's a whole lot more complicated.","price":"$ 14.68"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Chen-Naim, Ami"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5547065.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"48","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5547065.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5547065.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5547065.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2842878\/","id":"2842878","publisher":"Lone Pine Pub","isbn10":"1551055562","isbn13":"9781551055565","title":"The Spark Inside","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2842878","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The Spark Inside reveals, in easily understood language, the innate health and spiritual power that resides in each and every one of us.

Now he brings us the long-awaited follow-up to The Notebook-a story of an ordinary man who goes to extraordinary lengths to win back the love of his life... After thirty years, Wilson Lewis is forced to face a painful truth: the romance has gone out of his marriage. His wife, Jane, has fallen out of love with him, and it is entirely his fault. Despite the shining example of his in-laws, Noah and Allie Calhoun, and their fifty-year love affair (originally recounted in The Notebook), Wilson himself is a man unable to express his true feelings. He has spent too little time at home and too much at the office, leaving the responsibility of raising their children to Jane. Now his daughter is about to marry, and his wife is thinking about leaving him. But if Wilson is sure of anything, it is this: His love for Jane has only grown over the years, and he will do everything he can to save their marriage. With the memories of Noah and Allie's inspiring life together as his guide, he vows to find a way to make his wife fall in love with him...all over again. In this powerfully moving tale of love lost, rediscovered, and renewed, Nicholas Sparks once again brings readers his unique insight into the only emotion that ultimately really matters.","price":"USD 15.15"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Allister"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"288","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2914419\/","id":"2914419","publisher":"Univ of Chicago Pr","isbn10":"0226768589","isbn13":"9780226768588","title":"Beyond the Miracle","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2914419","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"32.5"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Edith"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s12708222.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"329","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s12708222.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s12708222.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s12708222.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2903550\/","id":"2903550","publisher":"Univ of North Carolina Pr","isbn10":"0807857750","isbn13":"9780807857755","title":"Capital Intentions","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2903550","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"162.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Barry"],"pubdate":"2005-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s14455051.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"256","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s14455051.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s14455051.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s14455051.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2915470\/","id":"2915470","publisher":"McFarland & Co Inc Pub","isbn10":"0786423811","isbn13":"9780786423811","title":"Frank \"Home Run\" Baker","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2915470","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"In the decades before baseball fans became enamored of sluggers like Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx, very few players were identified with the long ball. Instead, the game was dominated by men like Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner, players who sprayed the ball around the park, stole bases and mastered the hit and run. In fact, only one player entered the baseball mythology for his slugging: Frank ?Home Run? Baker. Born in Trappe, Maryland, in 1886, Baker earned his moniker by hitting two game-changing homers in the 1911 World Series. That was the also the first year he led the American League in home runs, with the grand total of 11. Altogether, he led for four consecutive years (1911?1914), though he never hit more than 12 dingers in a single season. Playing third base for the Philadelphia Athletics and the New York Yankees, Baker led the way for the more Ruthian totals to come in the Roaring ?20s. His is the story of a young player who at the height of his career risked throwing it all away in a contract dispute with the legendary Connie Mack.

Jeremy se enfrenta a una extraordinaria verdad: la emociÃ³n que te puede romper el corazÃ³n es, a veces, la misma que lo puede sanar. \/ There are a few things Jeremy Marsh was sure he'd never do: he'd never leave New York City; never give his heart away again after barely surviving one failed marriage; and most of all, never become a parent. Now, Jeremy is living in the tiny town of Boone Creek, North Carolina, married to Lexie Darnell, the love of his life, and anticipating the birth of their daughter. But just as his life seems to be settling into a blissful pattern, an unsettling and mysterious message re-opens old wounds and sets off a chain of events that will forever change the course of this young couple's marriage.","price":"$ 27.06"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Davis, Karen\/ Sparks, Jason"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4425126\/","id":"4425126","publisher":"","isbn10":"1585281883","isbn13":"9781585281886","title":"Getting Started in Aseptic Compounding Video Training Program","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4425126","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"2123.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Davis, Karen\/ Sparks, Jason"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20972042.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"53","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s20972042.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s20972042.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20972042.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4425276\/","id":"4425276","publisher":"","isbn10":"1585281891","isbn13":"9781585281893","title":"Getting Started in Non-Sterile Compounding Video Training Program","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4425276","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"32"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Gildner, Gary\/ Stone, Albert E.

Because while Vanda lets the little things get her down, she has a very good reason not to trust her new sponsor, Phil...or anyone of his kind. Phil has made a place for himself with the vampires.

If Cap wants to do the same thing, Grandpa will be happy to help. He'll even coach the team if the league gets off the ground. It does, and soon Cap and his friends are learning the rules of six-man football. Cap is in competition for the starting quarterback spot with Jimmy Cash, but that's not a problem. What is a problem is that Grandpa and Jimmy's grandfather have reignited an old football feud. When their rivalry starts to affect the team, Cap wonders if the team will survive.

It's hard to know whom to root for -- how can everyone emerge a winner?","price":"30.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Beatrice 编"],"pubdate":"2005-10","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s12137622.jpg","binding":"Pap","translator":[],"catalog":"","ebook_url":"https:\/\/read.douban.com\/ebook\/33254358\/","pages":"181","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s12137622.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s12137622.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s12137622.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2745989\/","id":"2745989","publisher":"Harpercollins Childrens Books","isbn10":"0060507217","isbn13":"9780060507213","title":"Finding Katie","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2745989","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","ebook_price":"46.09","price":"$ 6.77"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Spark, Debra"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Hardcover","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"299","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2728156\/","id":"2728156","publisher":"Graywolf Press","isbn10":"1555973523","isbn13":"9781555973520","title":"The Ghost of Bridgetown","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2728156","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$24.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Michal"],"pubdate":"2001-8","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4833996.jpg","binding":"HRD","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"48","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4833996.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4833996.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4833996.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/2756244\/","id":"2756244","publisher":"Harvest House Pub","isbn10":"0736906207","isbn13":"9780736906203","title":"My Very First Years Baby Book","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/2756244","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Too cute!

This book has been produced for outdoor enthusiasts who want their photographs to do full justice to the quality of their outdoor experience. A central theme is that point and shoot is a state of mind. It is not what camera you have, but how you use it that really counts. And how you use it depends first on seeing, and on knowing what you want your pictures to convey. There is still a place for technique, and essential technical concepts are introduced and explained in the clearest possible language, and with a sense of humour. Throughout the book, the emphasis is on practical advice, and on integrating photography with the rest of your outdoor life. There are chapters on landscape, action and wildlife and close-up photography. Throughout the book the text and illustrations are related specifically to climbing, cycling, caving, and many other activities. Specific advice is given for compact camera users. The book is illustrated with over 100 colour photographs, chosen both to illustrate specific points and to provide inspiration.","price":"$ 22.54"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, David"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20842950.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"220","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s20842950.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s20842950.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20842950.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4519985\/","id":"4519985","publisher":"","isbn10":"1551454890","isbn13":"9781551454894","title":"Prayers to Share, Year C","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4519985","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"192.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"A grand unification : yrots snerdlihc a [i.e. a children's story] as seen from the inside of a magnetic field","author":["Derf Q Sevas"],"pubdate":"1992","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Unknown Binding","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/3897481\/","id":"3897481","publisher":"Cosmos Free Press","isbn10":"096327290X","isbn13":"9780963272904","title":"The big spark","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/3897481","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Spark, Muriel"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4497086\/","id":"4497086","publisher":"","isbn10":"1439501459","isbn13":"9781439501450","title":"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4497086","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"21.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["CliffsNotes"],"pubdate":"2009-5","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9057950.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"72","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s9057950.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s9057950.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9057950.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/4489565\/","id":"4489565","publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company","isbn10":"0470460253","isbn13":"9780470460252","title":"CliffsNotes on Nicholas Sparks' A Walk to Remember","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/4489565","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Help your students get the most from Nicholas Sparks′  A Walk to Remember  with CliffsNotes—the original study guides.

Starting from the principle that health-care-providers and patients try to speak the same language to reach the best decisions for patient care, but often misunderstand each other whilst navigating the process of diagnosis, treatment and care, Lisa Sparks and Melinda Villagran clearly explain how health communication theory and research can help us better understand these complex interactions, and provide strategies for improving patient and provider communication. Sparks and Villagran cover a broad range of key issues and theories related to provider-patient interaction, including patient information and affective needs, barriers to effective communication in health-care contexts, and communication skills training for providers. Drawing on the most current literature in this vibrant field, they show the transformations that new technologies such as e-mail and text messaging have brought to communication with and between patients and providers, consider the roles of caregivers, both formal and informal, and illustrate how health-care organizations impact on interpersonal interactions. Throughout the book, Sparks and Villagran deftly illustrate how communicative understandings of patient-provider interaction can have positive practical outcomes, feeding into health behaviour change, creating a communication environment which can improve health literacy and ultimately lead to better health outcomes. With groundbreaking insights, on-point explanations, and deeply moving examples, Patient and Provider Interaction illuminates and enriches what is most often one of the most important interactions of our lives.","price":"470.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Hows and Whys of Stopping Fascism","author":["Colin Sparks"],"pubdate":"1980-05","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5317508\/","id":"5317508","publisher":"Bookmarks","isbn10":"0906224020","isbn13":"9780906224021","title":"Never Again!","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5317508","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Dennis"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21509528.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"193","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s21509528.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s21509528.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s21509528.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5969164\/","id":"5969164","publisher":"","isbn10":"1935249827","isbn13":"9781935249825","title":"Leadership 180","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5969164","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"193.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Kerrelyn"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5629242.jpg","binding":"","translator":["Krugl, Nadya"],"catalog":"","pages":"349","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5629242.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5629242.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5629242.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5025868\/","id":"5025868","publisher":"","isbn10":"8466641556","isbn13":"9788466641555","title":"La Vida Secreta de un Vampiro = The Secret Life of a Vampire","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5025868","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Una tipica fiesta de solteros incluye cerveza y la presencia de mujeres guapas. Una fiesta de vampiros es igual a la anterior, aunque con algunas diferencias en lo que se refiere a la bebida. Y nadie celebra fiestas como las que organiza Jack, el hijo ilegitimo del legendario Casanova. Cuando una de sus fiestas se desmadra y aparece la poli, Jack debe dar explicaciones, pero la belleza de la oficial Lara Boucher lo deja mudo. Lara, por su parte, esta convencida de que se celebra algo mas que una fiesta de solteros. Â¿Que oculta Jack? Â¿Tendra algo que ver con la reciente desaparicion de un monton de mujeres jovenes en la ciudad?  Sus investigaciones revelan mas de lo que ella quiere saber, sobre todo acerca de este moderno Casanova. Pero si quiere ascender a detective, tendra que poner al descubierto todos los secretos de Jack y tratar de no exponer su propio corazon. Se trata de una novela \"\"romantico-vampirica\"\" con mucho romance, accion y humor. El titulo tiene gancho, y el informe de lectura es muy bueno: el protagonista es un vampiro de mas de 200 aÃ±os, hijo del famoso Casanova...     \/    A typical bachelor party is all about beers and beautiful women. A vampire bachelor party is no different -- except the men are drinking Blissky (whiskey-flavored synthetic blood). And no one can throw a party quite like Jack, the illegitimate son of the legendary Casanova. But when the party gets out of hand and the cops show up, Jack has some explaining to do if only he wasn't struck speechless by the beauty of Officer Lara Boucher. Lara is sure there's something more than a bachelor party going on. What is Jack hiding? And why is he so interested in the recent disappearance of young women all over town? Her investigation uncovers more than she wants to know, especially about this modern-day Casanova. But if she's ever to make detective, she'll need to expose all his secrets if only her heart wasn't on the line.","price":"$ 23.67"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Crown"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5476751.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"76","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5476751.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5476751.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5476751.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5970202\/","id":"5970202","publisher":"","isbn10":"124042227X","isbn13":"9781240422272","title":"The English Frier, Or, the Town Sparks a Comedy as It Is Acted by Their Majesty's Servants \/ By Mr. Crowne.","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5970202","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 20.06"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Muriel Spark"],"pubdate":"2005-4-28","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11103118.jpg","binding":"Paperback","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"160","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s11103118.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s11103118.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11103118.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5261453\/","id":"5261453","publisher":"Penguin","isbn10":"014100598X","isbn13":"9780141005980","title":"The Finishing School","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5261453","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Passionately determined to write his novel whilst running College Sunrise, a finishing school for both sexes and mixed nationalities, Rowland Mahler is assisted by his wife, Nina Parker.

Starting from the principle that health-care-providers and patients try to speak the same language to reach the best decisions for patient care, but often misunderstand each other whilst navigating the process of diagnosis, treatment and care, Lisa Sparks and Melinda Villagran clearly explain how health communication theory and research can help us better understand these complex interactions, and provide strategies for improving patient and provider communication. Sparks and Villagran cover a broad range of key issues and theories related to provider-patient interaction, including patient information and affective needs, barriers to effective communication in health-care contexts, and communication skills training for providers. Drawing on the most current literature in this vibrant field, they show the transformations that new technologies such as e-mail and text messaging have brought to communication with and between patients and providers, consider the roles of caregivers, both formal and informal, and illustrate how health-care organizations impact on interpersonal interactions. Throughout the book, Sparks and Villagran deftly illustrate how communicative understandings of patient-provider interaction can have positive practical outcomes, feeding into health behaviour change, creating a communication environment which can improve health literacy and ultimately lead to better health outcomes. With groundbreaking insights, on-point explanations, and deeply moving examples, Patient and Provider Interaction illuminates and enriches what is most often one of the most important interactions of our lives.","price":"184.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Loader, Ian; Sparks, Richard"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11864908.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"208","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s11864908.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s11864908.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11864908.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5928609\/","id":"5928609","publisher":"","isbn10":"0415445493","isbn13":"9780415445498","title":"Public Criminology?","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5928609","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"1081.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Beatrice 编"],"pubdate":"1998-7","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4859887.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"231","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s4859887.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s4859887.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s4859887.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5063319\/","id":"5063319","publisher":"","isbn10":"0780797035","isbn13":"9780780797031","title":"Annie's Baby","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5063319","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"When Annie discovers she's pregnant by her boyfriend, she's devastated.

Upon their return to civilization, the story develops into an American Civil War adventure. The book begins: The Master of the Swiftsure, ignorant of the acute observations that wise Solon addressed to another potentate almost as supreme in his domain as a lord of the sea on his quarterdeck, counted himself a happy man, although he was yet young and very much alive. The two objects upon which his happiness rested, so he thought, as securely as the foundations of the deep are laid in the bars of the sea-as Sailor Jonah would phrase it-were both at this moment before his vision.

Drawing on the experience of many well-known journalists in the field, the author identifies the skills, common factors and special circumstances involved in a wide variety of investigations. It examines how opportunities for investigations can be found and pursued, how informants can be persuaded to yield needed information and how and where this information can be checked. It also stresses the dangers and legal constraints that have to be contended with and shows real life examples such as the Cook Report formula, the Jonathan Aitken investigation and the Birmingham Six story. David Spark, himself a freelance writer of wide experience, examines how opportunities for investigations can be found and pursued, how informants can be persuaded to yield needed information and how and where this information can be checked. He also stresses the dangers and legal constraints that have to be contended with and shows investigators at work in two classic inquiries:  * The mysterious weekend spent in Paris by Jonathan Aitken, then Minister of Defence Procurement * The career of masterspy Kim Philby  Investigative Reporting looks at such fields for inquiry as company frauds (including those of Robert Maxwell), consumer complaints, crime, police malpractice, the intelligence services, local government and corruption in Parliament and in overseas and international bodies.  The author believes that the conclusions that emerge from this far-reaching survey are of value not only in investigative journalism, but to practitioners in all branches of reporting.","price":"GBP 33.99"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6374244\/","id":"6374244","publisher":"","isbn10":"0841610843","isbn13":"9780841610842","title":"Reno & Sparks, Nevada Slicker","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6374244","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"70.00 元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Vielfalt als Chance - Grundlagen einer vorurteilsbewussten Bildung und Erziehung","author":["Sabine Beyersdorff","Stefani Boldaz-Hahn","Louise Derman-Sparks","Christa Dommel","Stephanie Gerlach","Evelyne Höhme-Serke","Monika Keller","Daniela Kobelt-Neuhaus","Anke Krause","Antje Richter","ManuEla Ritz","Tim Rohrmann","Regine Schallenberg-Diekmann","Serap Sikcan"],"pubdate":"2008-4-7","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6330798.jpg","binding":"Gebundene Ausgabe","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"256","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6330798.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6330798.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6330798.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6384194\/","id":"6384194","publisher":"Verlag Herder","isbn10":"345132119X","isbn13":"9783451321191","title":"Handbuch Kinderwelten","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6384194","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"EUR 22.95"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Christine"],"pubdate":"1986-11","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7142587.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7142587.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7142587.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7142587.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5506423\/","id":"5506423","publisher":"","isbn10":"0812432916","isbn13":"9780812432916","title":"The Elephant Man","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5506423","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"John Merrick had lived for more than twenty years imprisoned in a body that condemned him to a miserable life in the workhouse and to humiliation as a circus sideshow freak.

It is also the inspiring story of Reverend Sykes' work with the United Methodist Church to pass the first global resolution advocating the elimination of mercury from medicine, a nascent social justice movement on par with historical faith-based campaigns against child labor and slavery. With pragmatism and compassion, Sacred Spark calls for putting the well-being of children first. Through Sacred Sparks unflinchingly honest, first-person account, parents and physicians demanding safer vaccines will find clarity to support their informed choices as well as inspiration and guidance to become advocates for children. Woven seamlessly into the books engrossing narrative are Rev. Sykes victories in appropriate and landmark biomedical treatments for her son, the success of empowered parents to enact state bans on mercury and to approach Attorney Generals across the country, attempts to find precious allies against a corrupt and protected industry, and her familys lawsuit defeat against a pharmaceutical company. As a Princeton Theological Seminary graduate and minister of 19 years, Rev. Sykes inspires the reader to go beyond compromised scientific studies and profit-driven political debates, and examine the mercury\/autism issue through the first-hand experience of a mother and the faith and conviction of a minister. Sacred Spark ultimately teaches us that it is ordinary people who ignite the fire of reform.","price":"$ 25.93"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Michaels, Trista Ann"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7476871.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"182","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7476871.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7476871.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7476871.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6382087\/","id":"6382087","publisher":"","isbn10":"1419958976","isbn13":"9781419958977","title":"Spark of Magic","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6382087","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Nicholas and Darien had promised their father they would find Rebecca and keep her safe from the warlock who was determined to see her dead.

Ten-year-old Icy Sparks already has one strike against her: She's an orphan. Life becomes even more difficult when Icy develops strange symptoms: violent tics, inexplicable convulsions, sudden outbursts, and uncontrollable cursing that accompany her rare neurological disorder. Her affliction goes undiagnosed until adulthood, but the all-too-visible signs are the source of endless mystery and hilarity as everyone around offers an opinion about what's troubling the girl.

It will help you, the professional, write better letters and memorandums. It will help you avoid common errors, organize your messages, express yourself clearly, and find more information when you need it. It will teach you the basic survival skills. The emphasis in CommonSense Grammar and Style is always on simplicity. When several approaches to a common problem are possible, this book presents the least complicated and the most consistent. If you follow its advice, you will be on safe ground, but you must realize that other good writers may choose other correct solutions. CommonSense Grammar and Style relies on Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (called \"Merriam-Webster\") for the spelling of words and abbreviations. Merriam-Webster is widely recognized as the American standard. In matters of usage, especially business usage, CommonSense Grammar and Style depends heavily on The Gregg Reference Manual (called \"Gregg\") by William A. Sabin. Careful readers will, however, notice occasional differences between the two. For example, Gregg ignores Merriam-Webster's simplification of abbreviations while this book welcomes it, and Gregg does not object to the use of data as a singular noun. This book does. This book, especially when purchased with the accompanying workbook, will allow you to develop the grammar and style skills necessary to excel in business communications.","price":"$ 22.60"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Anderson, William Ballantyne"],"pubdate":"2010-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6401638.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"120","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s6401638.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s6401638.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s6401638.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6463657\/","id":"6463657","publisher":"","isbn10":"1145909965","isbn13":"9781145909960","title":"A Spectroscopic Study of the Spark Spectrum in Various Gases at High Pressure ...","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6463657","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 22.32"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Jaye, Ana"],"pubdate":"2004-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8029241.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"148","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8029241.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8029241.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8029241.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7073360\/","id":"7073360","publisher":"","isbn10":"0595323839","isbn13":"9780595323838","title":"Enduring Sparks","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7073360","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Years of carefree backyard campouts come to a sudden halt when a terrifying creature confirms Dinby's childhood suspicion that monsters really do exist.

The first Frugal took the gambling world by storm by showing how small players can get in on the bonanza of casino giveaways, including free rooms, free food, and free shows. Now Queen Jean is back with a veritable truckload of new frugal advice for recreational gamblers who want to stretch their money and fun in casinos. This is a powerhouse packed with new and improved techniques for navigating the fast-growing and constantly changing casino scene.

Captivated by Muriel Spark's lively wit, and her skill in combining complicated narrative technique with richness of theme, she has undertaken to produce this work. A BBC news article which appeared at the time of Dame Muriel Spark's death described her as \"one of the liveliest and most original literary talents to be discovered in Britain since the end of Word War II\" Like the famous Jacques in Shakespeare's \"As You Like It,\" Muriel Spark seems to see: \"All the world's a stage\/And all the men and women merely players\/They have their exits and their entrances\/And one man in his time plays many parts\/His acts being seven ages...\" Old people become babes again. School-boys (or girls) grow into their prime. Lovers, lawyers, bachelors, spinsters all make their way across the stage in her fiction. Their performances, during the brief moment they remain on stage, are observed and cleverly depicted under her skilful pen for the enjoyment of her readers. Five novels, generally considered to be among her best, have been chosen to show how Muriel Spark manages to make those brief moments, mere spots in time, transcend time itself. They are: \"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,\" \"The Girls of Slender Means,\" \"The Mandelbaum Gate,\" \"The Driver's Seat\" and \"Memento Mori.\"","price":"$ 14.63"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Crawford, Jack"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7219905.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"52","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7219905.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7219905.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7219905.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7590362\/","id":"7590362","publisher":"","isbn10":"1163703311","isbn13":"9781163703311","title":"Camp Fire Sparks","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7590362","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 15.32"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Winchell, Alexander"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7222848.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"402","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7222848.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7222848.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7222848.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7592269\/","id":"7592269","publisher":"","isbn10":"1163794376","isbn13":"9781163794371","title":"Sparks from a Geologist's Hammer","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7592269","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 31.59"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Jared"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7821687.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"532","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7821687.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7821687.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7821687.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7592390\/","id":"7592390","publisher":"","isbn10":"1163801372","isbn13":"9781163801376","title":"The Life of Gouverneur Morris","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7592390","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 37.02"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Jared;

When her employer gets his hands on Fleur's novel-in-progress, mayhem ensues when its scenes begin coming true. Generating hilarious turns of phrase and larger-than-life characters (especially Sir Quentin's batty mother), Spark's inimitable style make this literary joyride thoroughly appealing.","price":"$ 22.54"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Spark, Muriel"],"pubdate":"2005-12","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7735982.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7735982.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7735982.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7735982.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7082683\/","id":"7082683","publisher":"","isbn10":"0786180234","isbn13":"9780786180233","title":"The Finishing School","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7082683","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Passionately determined to write his novel whilst running College Sunrise, a finishing school for both sexes and mixed nationalities, Rowland Mahler is assisted by his wife, Nina Parker.

Soon enough, the men are variously tormented -- defrauded or stolen from; blackmailed or pressed to attend horrid seances -- and then plunged, all together, into the nastiest of lawsuits. At the center of that suit hovers pale, blank Patrick Seton, the medium. Meanwhile, horrors of every size plague the poor bachelors -- from the rising price of frozen peas (\"Your hand's never out of your pocket\") to epileptic fits, forgeries, spiritualists foaming with protoplasm, and murder. And every horror delights: each is lit up by Spark's uncanny wit -- at once malicious, funny, and deadly serious.

It will help you, the professional, write better letters and memorandums. It will help you avoid common errors, organize your messages, express yourself clearly, and find more information when you need it. It will teach you the basic survival skills. The emphasis in CommonSense Grammar and Style is always on simplicity. When several approaches to a common problem are possible, this book presents the least complicated and the most consistent. If you follow its advice, you will be on safe ground, but you must realize that other good writers may choose other correct solutions. CommonSense Grammar and Style relies on Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (called \"Merriam-Webster\") for the spelling of words and abbreviations. Merriam-Webster is widely recognized as the American standard. In matters of usage, especially business usage, CommonSense Grammar and Style depends heavily on The Gregg Reference Manual (called \"Gregg\") by William A. Sabin. Careful readers will, however, notice occasional differences between the two. For example, Gregg ignores Merriam-Webster's simplification of abbreviations while this book welcomes it, and Gregg does not object to the use of data as a singular noun. This book does. This book, especially when purchased with the accompanying workbook, will allow you to develop the grammar and style skills necessary to excel in business communications.","price":"$ 22.60"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Phillip S."],"pubdate":"2008-9","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8085959.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"70","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8085959.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8085959.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8085959.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10287420\/","id":"10287420","publisher":"","isbn10":"0981917275","isbn13":"9780981917276","title":"Commonsense Grammar and Style Workbook - 2nd Edition","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10287420","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This is the workbook accompanying the textbook, Commonsense Grammar and Style.

HIV-infected persons can experience a wide range of psychological and neuropsychological problems that require mental health treatment. At times, their family, friends, and healthcare workers may need mental health services. People at risk of infection may also benefit from mental health intervention. In  HIV and Community Mental Healthcare, Michael D. Knox and Caroline H. Sparks bring together a distinguished group of contributors in the first book on the unique contributions to prevention and treatment that community mental healthcare workers may make to persons affected by HIV.  The authors begin by discussing basic aspects of HIV disease with which mental health clinicians need to be familiar, such as epidemiology, law, ethics, detection, and transmission. They then address mental health interventions for stress, depression, and suicide. Special topics include women and HIV, multicultural issues, mental illness, and drug abuse.

Advances in research methodology, the use of synchrotron radiation in particular, are extensively reviewed. Roles of microbes, biomolecules, and environmental nanoparticles in mineral transformations, metal cycling, degradation of natural and anthropogenic organic compounds are also extensively reviewed. It is unique in terms of facilitating the integration of contributions from traditionally separate disciplines and adding a molecular and nanoparticle (therefore chemical) dimension to a field of endeavour that has traditionally been viewed on a different scale (dimension). It will also contribute to identifying knowledge gaps, providing future research directions and promoting research and education at the molecular level in this extremely important and challenging area of science for years to come. The IUPAC Project Committee noted that the Conference identifies, and builds on, the need to view and understand the Critical Zone at the molecular level. The book will be an invaluable reference for research and education.","price":"$ 202.27"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Donald L., PH."],"pubdate":"2012-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24966056.jpg","binding":"精装","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"320","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s24966056.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s24966056.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s24966056.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10563859\/","id":"10563859","publisher":"Academic Press","isbn10":"0123942756","isbn13":"9780123942753","title":"Advances in Agronomy","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10563859","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Advances in Agronomy  continues to be recognized as a leading reference and a first-rate source for the latest research in agronomy.

The scenic wonders, industry, and imagery of the West - with its fierce natives, brave cowboys and lucky prospectors - were immortalized in silver. Famed host and entrepreneur Fred Harvey, Navajo silversmiths and even Charles Tiffany & Co. played important roles in the spoon phenomenon. The fad ran its course by WWII but, by then, thousands of intricate designs had been produced. Today, they remain prized by collectors. This delightful book recounts the history of the souvenir spoon craze in the West. It brings together for the very first time both commercially produced and native designs, and features scores of dazzling, full-color photos filled with unique and rare examples from premier collections.","price":"$ 33.84"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Jared"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10718843.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"62","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s10718843.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s10718843.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s10718843.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10871067\/","id":"10871067","publisher":"","isbn10":"1179374223","isbn13":"9781179374222","title":"Remarks on a \"Reprint of the Original Letters from Washington to Joseph Reed","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10871067","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This is a reproduction of a book published before 1923.

In doing so it moves in place from comfortable suburbs to hard pressed inner city estates, from the affluent to the impoverished, from old people watching the town where they grew up change around them to young in-comers who are part of that change. This is a book which will give all students of crime a rare and fascinating insight into how issues at the heart of contemporary law and order politics both nationally and internationally actually play out on the ground.","price":"$ 189.84"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Cornish, A. 编"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8409162.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"348","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8409162.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8409162.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8409162.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10243773\/","id":"10243773","publisher":"","isbn10":"2503509061","isbn13":"9782503509068","title":"Sparks and Seeds","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10243773","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"John Freccero is internationally renowned for his scholarship on Dante, Petrarch, Macchiavelli, and other authors.

His numerous honours include Fulbright and Guggenheim fellowships and awards from the city of Florence and the Republic of Italy. His publications encompass articles on film, philosophy, and literature of virtually all time periods. All the authors in this Festschrift are former students of Freccero. All the articles appertain to Italian literature - from Dennis Costa's literary analysis of Bonaventure's Itinerarium to Patricia Parker's tracing of the State of Maryland's medieval Italian motto back through its English Renaissance sources. Many pieces are concerned with Dante directly (Kleiner, Schnapp, Jacoff, Cornish, Ginsberg, Hawkins, Chiarenza), and several others dealing with medieval and Renaissance Italian subjects do so indirectly (Costa, Stephens, Quint). Two are concerned with pre-modern cultural and literary implications of the history of science (Stewart, Reeves); the remainder trace the afterlife of medieval or Renaisance Italian motifs in modern culture (Parker, West, Marcus).","price":"$ 89.27"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Royce, John Allen"],"pubdate":"2011-1","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9096770.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"272","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s9096770.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s9096770.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s9096770.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10731117\/","id":"10731117","publisher":"","isbn10":"0972412166","isbn13":"9780972412162","title":"The Golden Spark","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10731117","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 19.15"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Duelli, H."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8409957.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"418","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8409957.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8409957.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8409957.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10246219\/","id":"10246219","publisher":"","isbn10":"321182331X","isbn13":"9783211823316","title":"Mixture Formation in Spark-Ignition Engines","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10246219","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The main point represents mixture formation for spark ignition engines, with regard to the basic principles as well as the design and construction of carburettors, injection systems and intake manifolds.

She's pleasantly surprised when a ball of light and magic dances into her bedroom and bursts into the form of a person--but she isn't quite prepared for the six feet of sinew and muscle in an orange satin suit that remains when the pixie dust settles. He's spent two centuries catering to the whims and notions of disadvantaged kids. Sebastian Phate is accustomed to surprised stares. After all, human children did tend to believe what they saw in the movies, and his profession had always been grossly misrepresented. He did not expect the surprised stare to be on the face of a beautiful shapely woman. Surely there must be some mistake. Can anyone say 'repressed sexual desires'? While the FGI takes its time investigating (hmmm--), Kelsey and Sebastian concede that while serving others is rewarding, neglecting self is not. Both find they are more adventurous than they ever dreamed, and together they discover that hedonism is even better than it's cracked up to be.","price":"$ 13.56"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Carruthers, Thomas N."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7893909.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"170","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7893909.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7893909.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7893909.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7431471\/","id":"7431471","publisher":"","isbn10":"1166123987","isbn13":"9781166123987","title":"Sparks of Fire","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7431471","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 33.40"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, David R."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8744265.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"64","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8744265.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8744265.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8744265.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7911059\/","id":"7911059","publisher":"","isbn10":"160664243X","isbn13":"9781606642436","title":"The Winged Men of Orcon","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7911059","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"DOOMED BY THE CREATURES OF ORCON \"Out across distance, with its bleeding, crumpled bodies and the teeming swarms beyond, I saw as through a red mist the glittering, whirling maze of Leider's wondrous generators, and began to curse to myself.\" How had it come to this cosmic interplanetary crisis?

Included in this volume are \"The Mystery Ship,\" \"Under Sealed Orders,\" and \"The Wonderful Cheese.\" Beware German U-Boats  This \"Clyde Puffer\" may lob a haggis depth charge at you","price":"$ 11.24"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft; Spark, Muriel; Stanford, Derek"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8649206.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"242","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8649206.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8649206.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8649206.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7886424\/","id":"7886424","publisher":"","isbn10":"1258033739","isbn13":"9781258033736","title":"My Best Mary","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7886424","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 53.05"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Johnston, Charles; Sparks, Edwin Erle;"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7874983.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"162","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7874983.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7874983.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7874983.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7387164\/","id":"7387164","publisher":"","isbn10":"1165532131","isbn13":"9781165532131","title":"Narratives of Captivities","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7387164","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 19.84"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Creyk, Donald D."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8618325.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"48","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8618325.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8618325.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8618325.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7851706\/","id":"7851706","publisher":"","isbn10":"1169641490","isbn13":"9781169641495","title":"Sparks from the Camp Fire and Other Poems","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7851706","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 27.98"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Johnston, Charles; Sparks, Edwin Erle;"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7279662.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"162","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7279662.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7279662.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7279662.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7388947\/","id":"7388947","publisher":"","isbn10":"1165557088","isbn13":"9781165557080","title":"Narratives of Captivities","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7388947","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 33.40"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Jared"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7279110.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"258","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7279110.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7279110.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7279110.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7387667\/","id":"7387667","publisher":"","isbn10":"116553911X","isbn13":"9781165539116","title":"Letters on the Ministry, Ritual and Doctrines of the Protestant Episcopal Church Addressed to William E.

They also focus on such intriguing topics as how Hasidic masters are trained, the range of difficulties for which struggling Jews seek their help, the intuitive methods of counseling that are used, and the kinds of mystical and practical advice offered in response to life's challenges.

Stephen is a thirteen-year-old ward of the state-and a runaway who knows exactly what he is and what he wants. He's a gifted musician who wants a career in music. Who he is doesn't seem important-until his foster parents refuse to believe in his musical gift. Now, the lack of a last name and need for a solid identity hover in his dreams. He grew up in a small town orphanage. His foster home of the past few months was in another small town. He'd left one and couldn't go back to the other; the only place remaining was Clarkstowne-the big city a few miles away. He knew no one in Clarkstowne, yet he'd go there and search for someone who might understand his need. Stephen's simple \"I am what I am, I need what I need\" will change the perceptions of many people, beginning with the conductor of a respected symphony orchestra, a lonely boy, the musicians with whom he interacts, the friends he makes along the way, and the caseworkers and state officials who must straighten out the controversy centering on him.","price":"$ 25.93"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Roy, Sheila"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8303308.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"198","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s8303308.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s8303308.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s8303308.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10087670\/","id":"10087670","publisher":"","isbn10":"1413792235","isbn13":"9781413792232","title":"Igniting the Spark to Trigger It All","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10087670","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Twins Mindy and Winter are enjoying a peaceful jog when they are attacked by a killer.

Granted, formulas have to be memorized; for, it is partly through memorization that we eventually become 'unconsciously competent'. This means we are a true master of our skill, practicing it in an almost effortless, automatic sense. In mathematics, this means we have mastered the underlying algebraic language to the same degree that we have mastered our native tongue. Knowing formulas and understanding the reasoning behind them propels one towards the road to mathematical mastery, so essential in our modern high-tech society. This book consists of three major sections. Section I-Formulas-contains most of the formulas that you would expect to encounter during the first year of college (and perhaps the second) regardless of major. In addition, there are formulas rarely seen in such compilations, included as a mathematical treat for the inquisitive. Section II-Tables-includes both 'pure math' tables and physical-science tables, useful in a variety of disciples ranging from physics to nursing. As in Section I, some tables (e.g. Magic Squares) are included just for curiosity and fun. Fun in discovery definitely should be a part of our learning experience in mathematics. Section III-Puzzles and Curios-is all fun  Here, I have pulled together a variety of mathematical wonders and puzzles collected over three decades of teaching.","price":"$ 13.50"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Munro, Neil; Foulis, Hugh;"],"pubdate":"2009-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7546672.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"160","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7546672.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7546672.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7546672.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10478944\/","id":"10478944","publisher":"","isbn10":"160664355X","isbn13":"9781606643556","title":"The Vital Spark","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10478944","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"ONE SAVVY SCOT SKIPPER Ever wonder what it was like to be the Captain of a Clyde Puffer -- that is, a steamship on the beautiful lochs of the Scots highlands at the beginning of the twentieth century?

This earth-shattering event provokes Debbie to do the unthinkable: confess her love to Lisa. But first, Debbie embarks on a holy quest guided by the two founding-and only-members of a wacky, made-up faith called the Church of Blue. Their fast-paced, hilarious adventure leads to nudity in a church coat closet, an unexpected kiss in a cemetery, and eye-opening revelations about someone Debbie's been ignoring far too long-herself.","price":"$ 11.24"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Ellis, George Edward"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7899172.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"104","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7899172.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7899172.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7899172.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7443718\/","id":"7443718","publisher":"","isbn10":"1166284816","isbn13":"9781166284817","title":"Memoir of Jared Sparks","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7443718","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 18.03"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Rich, Daniel Leslie"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7919337.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"28","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7919337.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7919337.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7919337.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7491472\/","id":"7491472","publisher":"","isbn10":"1166904458","isbn13":"9781166904456","title":"Oscillatory Spark Discharges Between Unlike Metals","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7491472","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 14.42"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Jared"],"pubdate":"2010-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7176160.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"50","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7176160.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7176160.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7176160.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/7010906\/","id":"7010906","publisher":"","isbn10":"114494516X","isbn13":"9781144945167","title":"Letter to Lord Mahon","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/7010906","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"$ 18.93"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Undead or Alive","author":["Sparks, Kerrelyn"],"pubdate":"2012-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7668123.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"384","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7668123.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7668123.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7668123.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6991545\/","id":"6991545","publisher":"","isbn10":"0061958069","isbn13":"9780061958069","title":"Wanted","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6991545","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"He's a vampire from the big city . . .

It is clearly illustrated in colour with practical advice, tips and professional guidance. It also provides readers with a step-by-step guide to the camera's basic and advanced functions. Canon's Rebel T3i\/EOS 600D is the successor to the entry level Rebel T2i\/EOS 550D, yet combines some of the sophisticated features of the higher-end EOS 60D and EOS 7D models in an easy-to-use package. For point-and-shoot camera users stepping-up to a DSLR the Rebel T3i\/EOS 600D's Scene Intelligent Auto mode offers scene analysis and optimized settings. It also offers a range of creative filters including grainy black and white, soft focus, toy camera and miniature effect. The picture resolution matches that of the 60D and 7D and the new camera also offers Full HD 1080p video recording, although a lower frames per second (fps) rate of 3.7fps (the 60D attains 5.3fps; the 7D 8fps). The vari-angle 3-inch LCD screen also rotates, making it convenient when shooting above head height or at an awkward angle, when using Live.  This complete illustrated guide to the Canon Rebel T3i\/EOS 600D will fully equip its readers to master this system's exciting features and potential.","price":"$

She investigates closely the history of the Revival and its key critics, who manipulated Melville's life and writings in the service of their own particular social and political agendas. Although often boldly conjectural and speculative, Spark's assertions are based on her meticulous and thorough exploration of either newly opened or previously unexplored archival materials of leading Melville scholars -- Raymond Weaver, Charles Olson, Henry A. Murray, and Jay Leyda.In addressing the distinction between what she calls the radical and conservative Enlightenment -- the conservative masquerading as progressive its attempt to reconcile scientific truth and social order -- Spark makes her way through Melville's often confusing and contradictory texts and examines the disputes within Melville scholarship, which often center on the mesmerizing figure of Ahab as either a democratic hero or a totalitarian dictator, corresponding to the rival epistemologies of modern society.The manner in which Spark deals with these subjects may startle specialists in Melville and literary scholarship; at the same time this book is accessible to the general reader, to one who may have no prior knowledge of Melville, his life and works, or even an acquaintance with literary criticism.","price":"$ 62.15"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":[],"pubdate":"2002-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7163900.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"276","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7163900.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7163900.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7163900.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10022665\/","id":"10022665","publisher":"","isbn10":"0970887477","isbn13":"9780970887474","title":"Unexpected Sparks","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10022665","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Unexpected Sparks opens with a fatal fire for Sam Madison, Truro's local Lothario, as his insurance office burns to the ground.

His parents kept him sequestered for years for unusual reasons. An older sister moved away from home, taking Alex with her, but requests help. As Greg and Gwen listen, strangers they meet and show care for him, Alex begins to lead them to a number of mysterious places in the Pyrenees Mountains of Spain near a retreat full of interesting international guests. Greg and Gwen have insight into the mysteries that unfold as they explore. One mystery opens another with ensuing solutions in France, Spain, Myanmar\/Burma and Thailand. Old treasure returns to families generations later. Rare rubies emerge glowing from internal light. Caves appear with intact pictographs and ancient burial sites full of artifacts. Characters in the book have different skills, experiences in life, creativity for design and use of light for special decoration. Skills of observation reveal more mysteries. Each character shares philosophies and ideals learned from travel and living life with exuberance. Live life with zest, the mental spice.","price":"$ 16.88"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Auger, Monique"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7482408.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"94","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7482408.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7482408.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7482408.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/10103144\/","id":"10103144","publisher":"","isbn10":"1424125456","isbn13":"9781424125456","title":"Shadows from the Spark Within","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/10103144","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This is a collection of poems that I wish to share.

You can find ways to get more from your processes, with examples, case studies and scenarios. Solid-Liquid Filtration is a crucial step in the production of virtually everything in our daily lives, from metals, plastics and pigments through to foods (and crockery) and medicines. Using a practical and applied approach, Trevor Sparks has created a guide that chemical and process engineers can use to help them: understand how filtration processes affect production processes, production costs, product quality, environmental impact and productivity; optimize process development and project execution, with real examples and supporting software forms and tools; and, develop reporting tools to monitor processes, and find ways to get more from processes. This book's focus is helping process engineers understand their filtration processes better. Its accessible approach and style make it a valuable resource for anyone working in this sector, regardless of prior knowledge or experience. About the author - Trevor Sparks PhD., founder of Filter-Ability Ltd, Ireland, is a consultant within the filtration industry, working for end-users and technology-providers. He has worked in the process industries for 20 years and has focused on filtration for the last 15 of these. He has previously worked for BHR Group Limited, Larox Oyj (now a part of Outotec), Finland, and as a Marie-Curie Research Fellow at UC RUSAL in Ireland. He is a Member of the Council of the Filtration Society. Several examples and scenarios are provided throughout the book in order to help engineers understand the importance of filtration and the effect that it has on the bottom-line. It covers methods for optimizing processes and include process variable, plus laboratory testing, modeling and process troubleshooting. It is accompanied by optimization software that enables readers to model and plan optimal filtration processes and set ups for their particular circumstance.","price":"$

Twelve-year-old Tom Elm is just an ordinary turnip farmer from the Valley, but he's always felt destined for something bigger. So when he discovers everyone in his village is asleep and plagued by nightmares, he assembles a band of unlikely heroes. They must fight to preserve the Spark--a divine light born at the core of a vast, dark nothingness called the Nacht. The Nacht is trying to permeate the Waking World with nightmares of the Dreaming, and it's Tom's mission to defeat the Nacht and its most loyal follower, the Constable. If he fails, his family--and everyone--might never wake up again.","price":"168.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Spark, Muriel"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7490409.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7490409.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7490409.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7490409.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6038145\/","id":"6038145","publisher":"","isbn10":"1433206145","isbn13":"9781433206146","title":"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6038145","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"HarperCollins UK Audio Classics presents abridged and unabridged readings of the world's favorite literary masterpieces.

Numerous examples drawn from secondary school lessons and units are examined through reflection on each strategy's strengths\/weaknesses, where\/when\/with whom it would be most effective, how to modify it to meet the needs of special learners, and what values and\/or social relationships it promotes. In addition, a case study involving a multidisciplinary middle-school unit on Zimbabwe ties text-sanctioned practices to unit\/lesson planning that meets state and local standards.","price":"$ 157.97"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Donald L., PH."],"pubdate":"2010-8","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26638161.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"232","images":{"small":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s26638161.jpg","large":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s26638161.jpg","medium":"https://img3.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s26638161.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5496480\/","id":"5496480","publisher":"","isbn10":"0123810337","isbn13":"9780123810335","title":"Advances in Agronomy, Volume 107","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5496480","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"Advances in Agronomy continues to be recognized as a leading reference and a first-rate source for the latest research in agronomy.

It encompasses the range of Spark's output, pursuing contextual lines of approach including biography, geography, gender, identity, nation and religion, and considering her legacy and continuing influence in the twenty-first century. Spark emerges here as a serious thinker on issues as diverse as the Welfare State, secularisation, decolonisation, and anti-psychiatry, and a writer whose work may be placed alongside Proust, Joyce, Nabokov, and Lessing. The critics collected here are mindful of how, although overwhelmingly known as a novelist, by the time of her first novel, The Comforters, in 1957, Spark already had a significant profile through poetry, biographical criticism, and literary journalism, as chair of the Poetry Society and editor of the Poetry Review, and as author or co-author of a number of scholarly studies of writers including Wordsworth, Mary Shelley, the Brontes, Cardinal Newman, and John Masefield. Within a relatively modest space this Companion touches on the whole range of Spark's work and, in introducing the oeuvre thematically for those looking to explore this elegant and challenging author further, also sets the agenda for future Spark studies.

Returning home, John must come to grips with the fact that Savannah, now married, is still his true love--and face the hardest decision of his life.","price":"$ 20.32"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Donald L., PH."],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"212","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/f\/shire\/5522dd1f5b742d1e1394a17f44d590646b63871d\/pics\/book-default-lpic.gif"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5473769\/","id":"5473769","publisher":"","isbn10":"0123810353","isbn13":"9780123810359","title":"Advances in Agronomy v106, Volume 106","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5473769","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":"1367.00"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks, Irving A."],"pubdate":"1992-2","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7986098.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"64","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s7986098.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s7986098.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s7986098.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/5473711\/","id":"5473711","publisher":"","isbn10":"006250827X","isbn13":"9780062508270","title":"Exploring \"The World's Religions\"","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/5473711","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The perfect companion to Huston Smith's  The World's Religions  -- a classroom-tested workbook for the understanding of humankind's wisdom traditions.","price":"72.00元"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Winchell, Alexander"],"pubdate":"2010-3","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5252975.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"420","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s5252975.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s5252975.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s5252975.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/6236835\/","id":"6236835","publisher":"","isbn10":"1147597952","isbn13":"9781147597950","title":"Sparks from a Geologist's Hammer","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/6236835","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.

Written by leading scientists in the field, it covers a range of topics relevant to the search for life in the Universe, including: cosmology and its implications for the emergence of life, the habitable zone in the Milky Way Galaxy, the formation of stars and planets, the study of interstellar and interplanetary matter, searches for extrasolar planets, the synthesis of organic material in space, and spectroscopic signatures that could be used to detect life.

The students had three different concepts of the role of the press: the enlightenment model in which the prime functions is to educate and inform; the power model, ensuring the views of socially powerful groups are publicized; and the entertainment model, which provides the audience with distractions.

Beautiful yet self-effacing, Katie seems determined to avoid forming personal ties until a series of events draws her into two reluctant relationships: one with Alex, a widowed store owner with a kind heart and two young children; and another with her plainspoken single neighbor, Jo. Despite her reservations, Katie slowly begins to let down her guard, putting down roots in the close-knit community and becoming increasingly attached to Alex and his family. \n\nBut even as Katie begins to fall in love, she struggles with the dark secret that still haunts and terrifies her . . . a past that set her on a fearful, shattering journey across the country, to the sheltered oasis of Southport. With Jo's empathic and stubborn support, Katie eventually realizes that she must choose between a life of transient safety and one of riskier rewards . . . and that in the darkest hour, love is the only true safe haven.","price":"CDN$ 16.50"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"Cartoonists Draw the Line at Parkinson's","author":["Sparks, Chris"],"pubdate":"","tags":[],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20606757.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"128","images":{"small":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s20606757.jpg","large":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s20606757.jpg","medium":"https://img1.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s20606757.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11590289\/","id":"11590289","publisher":"","isbn10":"1449419666","isbn13":"9781449419660","title":"Team Cul de Sac","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/11590289","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"","price":""},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Draper, Sharon M.; Watson, Jesse Joshua;"],"pubdate":"2012-9","tags":[{"count":1,"name":"童年","title":"童年"},{"count":1,"name":"物品","title":"物品"},{"count":1,"name":"怀旧","title":"怀旧"},{"count":1,"name":"90后","title":"90后"}],"origin_title":"","image":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11210784.jpg","binding":"","translator":[],"catalog":"","pages":"144","images":{"small":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/s\/public\/s11210784.jpg","large":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/l\/public\/s11210784.jpg","medium":"https://img9.doubanio.com\/view\/subject\/m\/public\/s11210784.jpg"},"alt":"https:\/\/book.douban.com\/subject\/11587280\/","id":"11587280","publisher":"","isbn10":"1442454571","isbn13":"9781442454576","title":"Stars and Sparks on Stage","url":"https:\/\/api.douban.com\/v2\/book\/11587280","alt_title":"","author_intro":"","summary":"The Clubhouse kids compete for a big prize—and make some creative moves—in this repackaged and talent-filled tale from bestselling author Sharon Draper.

A pull-out reference card gives quick access to the camera's functions. UK author Jon Sparks gives an in-depth guide to using this impressive camera, with hints and tips. The D800 is the biggest news to emerge from Nikon since 2008, when they introduced their last all-new full-frame DSLR, the D700. The D800 is a complementary or alternative to Nikon's own new professional camera, the D4, but at half the price. The D800 packs in more resolution than any other full-frame DSLR by a huge margin, with more than twice as many pixels as the D4. Built for today's multimedia photographer, the D800 has a powerful 36.3mp. The camera's extremely high image quality comes from a body that weighs less than any other Nikon full-frame digital camera, making it ideal for landscape, commercial and studio photography, but with the flexibility to appeal to enthusiastic amateurs who can justify its price tag.","price":"$ 22.54"},{"rating":{"max":10,"numRaters":0,"average":"0.0","min":0},"subtitle":"","author":["Sparks,

In addition, the appertaining measuring techniques are also discussed. The basic principles of combustion are discussed to such an extent that is necessary to understand the effects of mixture formation. The book should provide an overall insight on the state of the art, as well as complete information for the industrial engineer, scientific and university students.
